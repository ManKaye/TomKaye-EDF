                <p>I have studied at Loughborough University for two years, with hopes of attended a placement for my third year. I was successful in my endeavors and acquired a placement with EDF Energy that would last a year, from September in 2015 until the end of August in 2016.</p>
                <p>I like to think I have learnt a lot regarding how a large business like EDF Energy functions and how the different branches of a business interact with one another, as well as gaining knowledge on certain business processes that are abstracted when learning Computer Science at university - which is very theory-based.</p>
                <p>I have enjoyed meeting new people here and as a result, building up my own network of acquaintances. The level of freedom is also very comforting to know, although I'm sure it will be more challenging if I were given an actual graduate scheme with them.</p>
