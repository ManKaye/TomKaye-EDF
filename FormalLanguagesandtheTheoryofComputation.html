                <u>Formal Languages</u>
                <p>Formal languages are sets of strings and symbols. They belong to the field of 
                    non-commutative discrete mathematics.<br/>Alphabet `\Sigma = \text{an often finite set of symbols or letters}`<br/>
                    `\text{Word} (\text{over} \Sigma) = \text{a usually finite string of symbols from} \Sigma`. An empty word `\epsilon` is a word of length 0.<br/>
                    `\text{Language} (\text{over} \Sigma) = \text{an often infinite set of words over} \Sigma`<br/>
                    Class of languages = a set of languages<br/>
                    `\text{Concatenation } \cdot = \text{a binary function that maps two words}`<br/>`\text{to each other}`, so words v and w would become vw in the sense that `v \cdot w = vw` (concatenation is non-commutative)<br/>
                    Kleene star * = an operation generating the language L* of all finite words that result from concatenating any words in L<br/>
                    `\text{Free monoid } \Sigma * = \text{the set of all words over} \Sigma`<br/>
                    `\text{Free semigroup } \Sigma+ = \Sigma* \ {\epsilon}`<br/>
                    Complement L' of a language `L = \Sigma* \ L`<br/>
                    Factor of a word w = any word v such that `w = u_1vu_2` for some words `u_1, u_2`</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Homo-Morphisms</u>
                <p>Example: `h:{a, b}* \rightarrow {a, b}*`<br/>
                    `h(x) := {\text{bba}\quad \text{if}\quad x = a,`<br/>
                    a<br/>
                    `\text{if}\quad x = b,`
                    b}<br/>
                    h(abb) = bbaaa<br/>
                    A homo-morphism is simply one Kleene star that morphs to another Kleene star 
                    if it is compatible with the concatenation.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Set-formers</u>
                <p>A set-former describes a language in the following way:<br/>
                    `L = {w | \text{something about} w}`<br/>
                    Example: `L = {w \in {a, b}\ast | |w|_a = |w|_b}`</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Grammars</u>
                <p>A grammar, or language generator is a device that describes how to enumerate 
                    all words in a language. A grammar provides rules to produce these words but 
                    unfortunately doesn't lead to a simple test of whether a word is in that 
                    language or not.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Automata</u>
                <p>An automaton or a language acceptor is a computational device that reads any 
                    word and outputs 'yes' if it is in the language and 'no' if it isn't, although 
                    this doesn't always happen. Automata allow us to test easily on whether words 
                    are in a language although it makes it difficult to obtain all the words in a 
                    language.<br/>Set-formers are easy for humans to read but not formal enough for 
                    a computer to compute. Grammars and automata are the opposite, computers can 
                    use these but most example of these are too big and complicated for humans to 
                    read.<br/>As a solution, regular expressions, Backus-Naur Form/Extended 
                    Backus-Naur Form and patterns are used.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Notation & Remarks</u>
                <p>If M is a grammar or automaton then L(M) is the language generated/accepted by 
                    that grammar or automaton.<br/>
                    If <i>M</i> is a set of grammars or automata then L(<i>M</i>) denotes the class 
                    of all languages that are generated/accepted from <i>M</i>.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>The Membership Problem</u>
                <p>Input: word w<br/>
                    Output: 'yes' is `w \in L`, 'no' otherwise<br/>
                    The membership problem for L is decidable if there is a computable 
                    function `\chi_L` that solves the problem for every w. L is 
                    decidable/recursive.<br/>If there is a computable function that outputs 'yes' 
                    when reading any word `w \in L`, and is undefined otherwise then L is 
                    semi-decidable/recursively enumerable.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Problem or Language?</u>
                <p>Observation: Any decision problem can be interpreted as the membership problem 
                    for a formal language.<br/>We simply encode the problem in a language.<br/>
                    Example: Is n a prime number?<br/>
                    `L = {w | w \text{ is a binary representation of a prime number}}`</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Equivalence Problem</u>
                <p>Input: Grammars or automata M, N<br/>
                    Output: 'yes' if L(M) = L(N), 'no' otherwise</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Inclusion Problem</u>
                <p>Input: Grammars or automata M, N<br/>
                    `\text{Output}: '\text{yes}' \text{if } L(M) \subseteq L(N), '\text{no}' \text{ otherwise}`</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Disjointness Problem</u>
                <p>Input: Grammars or automata M, N<br/>
                    `\text{Output}: '\text{yes}' \text{ if }L(M) \cap L(N) = \emptyset, '\text{no}' \text{ otherwise}`</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Finiteness Problem</u>
                <p>Input: Grammar or automaton M<br/>
                    Output: 'yes' if L(M) is finite, 'no' otherwise</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Emptiness Problem</u>
                <p>Input: Grammar or automaton M<br/>
                    `\text{Output}: '\text{yes}' \text{ if }L(M) = \emptyset, '\text{no}' \text{ otherwise}`</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Membership Problem for a Class `\mathcal{M}` of Grammars or Automata</u>
                <p>Input: Grammar or Automaton `M \in \mathcal{M}`, word w<br/>
                    `\text{Output}: '\text{yes}'\text{ if }w \in L(M), '\text{no}'\text{ otherwise}`</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Decidability of the Inclusion Problem</u>
                <p>Decidability and co-semi-decidability: The inclusion problem for a class <i>M</i> of 
                    grammars/automata is decidable if there exists a computable function that, 
                    given any `M, N \in mathcal{M}`, outputs 'yes' if `L(M) \subseteq L(N)` and 'no' if 
                    $L(M) \nsubseteq L(N)$, semi-decidable if there exists a computable function 
                    that, given any `M, N \in \mathcal{M}`, outputs 'yes' if `L(M) \subseteq L(N)` 
                    and is undefined if $L(M) \nsubseteq L(N)$, co-semi-decidable if there exists 
                    a computable function that, given any `M, N \in \mathcal{M}`, outputs 'yes' if 
                    $L(M) \nsubseteq L(N)$ and is undefined if `L(M) \subseteq L(N)`.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>How Difficult Is It to Solve a Decision Problem?</u>
                <p>Decision problems can be decidable, semi-decidable or co-semi-decidable. If 
                    they are decidable, then we wish to know the amount of time required for the 
                    characteristic function `\chi` to compute the correct answer when given an input of 
                    length n. We might also ask for the required memory space in big O notation 
                    although complexity questions won't be asked for this module.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Closure Properties</u>
                <p> Let <i>M</i> be a set of grammars or automata.<br/>
                    L(M) is said to be closed under union if, for all `M, N \in \mathcal{M}`, 
                    `L(M) \cup L(N) \in L(M)`.<br/>
                    L(M) is said to be closed under intersection if, for all `M, N \in 
                    \mathcal{M}`, `L(M) \cap L(N) \in L(M)`.<br/>
                    L(M) is said to be closed under complement if, for every `M \in \mathcal{M}, L(M)' \in L(M)`.</p>

                <u>Type 0 Grammars</u>
                <p>A (formal or phase-structure) grammar of Type 0 is a tuple G = (N, T, P, S) 
                    satisfying the following conditions:<br/>N is a finite alphabet of 
                    non-terminal symbols (or variables), T is a finite alphabet of terminal 
                    symbols (or letters), `N\cap T = \emptyset`, P is a set of production rules, 
                    i.e. P is a finite subset of `(N\cup T)^+ x (N\cup T)^\ast, S \in N` is a start 
                    variable.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Transition Relation</u>
                <p>Let G = (N, T, P, S) be a grammar of Type 0. Let `u, v \in (N\cup T)^\ast`. We 
                    define the transition relation `u \Rightarrow _Gv` if there exist 
                    `x, y, y', z \in (N\cup T)^\ast` such that u, v and P satisfy the following 
                    conditions:<br/>
                    `u = xyz`<br/>
                    `v = xy'z`<br/>
                    `y \rightarrow y'` is contained in P.<br/>
                    We write `\Rightarrow` instead of `\Rightarrow_G` if the grammar G is 
                    understood. `\Rightarrow_G^\ast` denotes the reflexive and transitive closure 
                    of `\Rightarrow_G`.</p>

                <u>The Language Generated by a Grammar</u>
                <p>Let G = (N, T, P, S) be a grammar of Type 0. G generates the following 
                    language:<br/>
                    `L(G) := {w \in T^\ast | S \Rightarrow_G^\ast w}`</p>

                <u>Expressive Power of Type 0 Grammars</u>
                <p>Theorem: The class of all languages that can be generated by Type 0 grammars 
                    equals the class of all semi-decidable (= recursively enumerable) languages.<br/>
                    Type 0 grammars are computationally maximally powerful. For example `{(h, g) | h, g \text{morphisms} \wedge E_{h, g} \ne \emptyset}` 
                    can be generated by a Type 0 grammar. There are Type 0 grammars G where L(G) 
                    cannot be recursively enumerated in length-lexicographical order.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Decision Problems</u>

                    Exception: If `\epsilon \in L(G)` shall be satisfied, then G may contain the

                    any rule in P.<br/>Let L be a language generated by a Type 1 grammar. We then 
                    call L a context-sensitive language. We denote the class of all

                    context-free:<br/>
                    Lemma (Pumping Lemma, version CF): Let `L \in CF`. Then there exists an 
                    `n \in \mathbb{N}` such that, for every `z \in L` with `|z| \geq n`, we can 
                    write z = uvwxy, where the following  conditions are satisfied:<br/>
                    . `|vwx| \leq n`,<br/>
                    . `vx \ne \epsilon`,<br/>
                    . For all `i \in \mathbb{N}_0, uv_iwx_iy \in L`.<br/>
                    Note that the conditions of the Pumping Lemma are a necessary condition for 
                    context-free languages, but not a sufficient one.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Example Application of the Pumping Lemma</u>
                <p>`L := {w | \exists k \in \mathbb{N} : w = a_kb_{2k}a_k}` is not context-free.<br/>
                    We apply the contraposition of the Pumping Lemma, i.e. we show that L does not 
                    satisfy the conditions of the Pumping Lemma, and this implies that L is not 
                    context-free:<br/>Let n be the constant provided by the Pumping Lemma. We now 
                    consider the word `z := a_nb_{2n}a_n`. Obviously, `z \in L` and `|z| \geq n`, 
                    and therefore we can consider the factorization z = uvwxy. Hence, we know that 
                    `|vwx| \leq n` and v or x are nonempty.<br/>We consider the following cases 
                    (assuming the previously stated conditions are both true):<br/>
                    . vx consists of a's only. Hence, by increasing i in condition 3, we can 
                    construct a word `a_mb_{2n}a_n` or `a_nb_{2n}a_m` with m > n. Since such a word 
                    is not in L, condition 3 is not satisfied.<br/>
                    . vx consists of b's only. Hence, by increasing i in condition 3, we can 
                    construct a word `a_nb_ma_n` with m > 2n. Since such a word is not in L, 
                    condition 3 is not satisfied.<br/>
                    . v or x consist of a's followed by b's or of b's followed by a's. Hence, by 
                    increasing i in condition 3, we can construct a word with arbitrarily many 
                    factors ab. Since such a word is not in L, condition 3 is not satisfied.<br/>
                    . v consists of a's only and x consists of b's only. Hence, by increasing i in 
                    condition 3, we can construct a word `a_mb_pa_n` with m > n. Since such a word 
                    is not in L, condition 3 is not satisfied.<br/>
                    . v consists of b's only and x consists of a's only. Hence, by increasing i in 
                    condition 3, we can construct a word `a_nb_pa_m` with m > n. Since such a word 
                    is not in L, condition 3 is not satisfied.<br/>
                    This reasoning covers all possible cases, and all of them show that the 
                    correctness of conditions 1 and 2 implies that condition 3 is not correct. Thus, 
                    L does not satisfy the conditions of the Pumping Lemma, and this implies 
                    `L \notin CF`.</p>

                    regular) if every rule `u \rightarrow v \in P` satisfies<br/>
                    v = a or v = aA<br/>
                    for an `a \in T` and an `A \in N`.<br/>
                    An exception of this is if `\epsilon \in L(G)` shall be satisfied, then G may 
                    contain the rule `S \rightarrow \epsilon`. However, then S must not occur on 
                    the right side of any rule in P.<br/>Let L be a language generated by a Type 3 
                    grammar. We then call L a regular language. We denote the class of all regular 
                    languages by REG.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Type 3 Grammars & Greibach Normal Form</u>
                <p>By definition, every Type 3 grammar is a Type 2 grammar. Additionally, we may 
                    note the following observation:<br/>Every Type 3 grammar is a Type 2 grammar 
                    in Greibach Normal Form.<br/>More precisely, a grammar G = (N, T, P, S) is of 
                    Type 2 and in GNF if all rules in P satisfy `A \rightarrow aB_1B_2...B_k` for 
                    some `a \in T` and `A, B_1, B_2, ..., B_k \in N`. Thus, such a grammar is of 
                    Type 3 if the additional restriction `k \in {0, 1}` is satisfied.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>A Regular Grammar</u>
                <p>Let `G_{rev} := ({S, A, B}, {a, b, c}, P, S)` where<br/>
                    `P = {S \rightarrow aA`<br/>
                    `S \rightarrow bB`<br/>
                    `A \rightarrow aS`<br/>
                    `B \rightarrow bB`<br/>
                    `B \rightarrow c}`<br/>
                    `L(G_{rev}) = {w | \exists u \in {a}^\ast, v \in {b}^+ : |u| \text{is even}`<br/>

                <u>Expressive Power</u>
                <p>FIN denotes the class of all finite languages.<br/>

                    explained on slides 22 and 23. Inclusion 2 can be understood easily.<br/>
                    The following witnesses show that the given hierarchy is proper:<br/>
                    . `(\text{PCP})' \in RE \backslash REC`<br/>
                    . Let c be a function that encodes a context-sensitive grammar G in a word w 
                    over a binary alphabet. Then `{w | w \notin L(c^{-1}(w))} \in REC \backslash CS`. The 
                    same holds for all recursive languages with an EXPSPACE-hard membership 
                    problem.<br/>
                    . `L(G_{copy}) = {w | \exists x \in {a, b}^+ : w = \text{xccx}} \in CS \backslash CF`<br/>
                    The same holds for other expressions.</p>

                <u>Applications of Regular Grammars</u>
                <p>Regular grammars are not used very often. However, other representations of 
                    regular languages - namely regular expressions and finite automata - are very 
                    important. They are mainly applied to<br/>
                    . Data mining<br/>
                    . Specifications and verification of the behaviour of simple controllers<br/>
                    Here, they are adequate despite their limited expressive power.</p>

                <u>Expressive Power of BNF, & Examples</u>
                <p>Let G be a grammar in BNF, then `L(G) \in CF`<br/>
                    Let G = ({A, B, S}, {a, b, c}, P, S), with<br/>
                    `P = {  S \rightarrow \text{aSa} | A | \epsilon`<br/>
                    `A \rightarrow b | B`<br/>
                    `B \rightarrow \text{cc} }`<br/>
                    Then G is in BNF<br/>
                    Since BNF is almost self-explanatory.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>EBNF (Extended Backus-Naur Form)</u>
                <p>Let G = (N, T, P, S) be  Type 2 grammar. G is said to be in extended 
                    Backus-Naur form if P is in BNF or if P contains production rules<br/>
                    `A \rightarrow \alpha[\beta]\gamma` or<br/>

                    and `[, ], {, } \notin (N \cup T)`.<br/>
                    Note that the meta-symbols of BNF and EBNF may be combined in EBNF, i.e. Rules

                    `A \rightarrow \alpha[\beta]\gamma | aA`<br/>
                    Are allowed in EBNF.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Interpretation of the Meta-symbols in EBNF</u>
                <p>The rule<br/>
                    `A \rightarrow \alpha[\beta]\gamma`<br/>
                    Means that the word `\beta` may, but does not need to be inserted between `\alpha`
                    and `\gamma`. Thus, this rule is short for the rules<br/>
                    `A \rightarrow \alpha\gamma` and `A \rightarrow \alpha\beta\gamma`.<br/>
                    The rule<br/>
                    `A \rightarrow \alpha{\beta}\gamma`<br/>
                    Means that the word `\beta` may be repeated an arbitrary number of times (this 
                    includes 0 times) between `\alpha` and `\gamma`. Thus, this rule is short for the 
                    rules<br/>
                    `A 'rightarrow \alpha\gamma` , `A \rightarrow \alpha\beta\gamma` , `B \rightarrow \beta`,
                    and `B \rightarrow \beta B`.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Expressive Power of EBNF</u>
                <p>Let G be a grammar in EBNF, then `L(G) \in CF`.<br/>
                    Let G = ({A, B, S}, {a, b, c}, P, S), with<br/>
                    `P = {  S \rightarrow A[S]B | \text{bb}{A}B | [B]a`<br/>
                    `A \rightarrow a`<br/>
                    `B \rightarrow \text{cc} }`<br/>
                    Then G is equivalent to G' = ({A, B, C, S}, {a, b, c}, P', S), with<br/>
                    `P' = { S \rightarrow AB, S \rightarrow ASB, S \rightarrow \text{bbB}, S \rightarrow \text{bbCB}`,<br/>

                <u>Regular Expressions</u>
                <p>We inductively define regular expressions<br/>
                    . `\emptyset`  is a regular expression<br/>
                    . `\epsilon` is a regular expression<br/>
                    . Any symbol a is a regular expression<br/>
                    `E | F, EF, E\ast, ( E )` are regular expressions.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Interpretations of Regular Expressions</u>
                <p>Let `L_1, L_2` be languages. Then<br/>
                    `L1 \cdot L2 := {w | \exists u \in L_1, v \in L_2 : w = uv}`.<br/>
                    We often simply write `L_1L_2z` instead of `L_1 \cdot L_2`.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Regular Expressions & Regular Languages</u>
                <p>Let R be the class of all regular expressions. Then L(R) = REG<br/>
                    The following problems are decidable for the class of regular expressions<br/>
                    . Membership<br/>
                    . Equivalence<br/>
                    . Inclusion<br/>
                    . Finiteness<br/>
                    . Emptiness</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Main Area of Application</u>
                <p>Due to their compact and natural appearance, regular expressions are very 
                    popular when searching for strings in larger texts. Here, a regular expression 
                    E is formulated by the user, and it asked whether the text is in `L(\Sigma\ast E\Sigma\ast)`.
                    Therefore, regular expressions are vital for data mining for example.<br/>
                    Regular expressions are also supported by most of today's text editors and 
                    programming languages which contain a REGEX engine, i.e. a programme that can 
                    perform the match test, which means that it can compute an answer to the 
                    membership problem.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>REGEX Engines</u>
                <p>Since the expressive power of regular expressions is limited, most REGEX 
                    engines support regular expressions that use concepts exceeding the original 
                    definition given above.<br/>In particular, they would allow the use of 
                    so-called back-references, which specify that a variable factor needs to be 
                    exactly repeated at several locations in the word.<br/>Some consequences:<br/>
                    Let REGEX be the class of languages generated by extended regular expressions. 
                    Then `CS \subset REGEX \subset REG`.<br/>
                    The membership problem for extended regular expressions is NP-complete</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Patterns</u>
                <p>Patterns can be interpreted as particular regular expressions with 
                    back-references. They were introduced by Dana Auglin in 1980.<br/>
                    . `\Sigma` is an alphabet of terminal symbols.<br/>
                    Example: `\Sigma = {a, b, c}`<br/>
                    . `X := {x_1, x_2, ...}` is an infinite alphabet of variables.<br/>
                    . A pattern is a word `\alpha \in (\Sigma \cup X)^\ast`.<br/>
                    Example: `\alpha = x_1 a x_2 b x_1`</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Expressive Power</u>
                <p>Most pattern languages are proper context sensitive languages:<br/>
                    Let `\Sigma` be a finite alphabet, `|\Sigma| \geq 2`.<br/>
                    . `CS \subset \text{nePAT}_{\Sigma,} CS \subset ePAT_\Sigma`<br/>
                    . `CF # \text{nePAT}_{\Sigma,} CF # ePAT_\Sigma`<br/>
                    . `REG # \text{nePAT}_{\Sigma,} REG # ePAT_\Sigma`<br/>
                    Let `\Sigma` be an alphabet, `|\Sigma| = 2`. Then `L_{NE,\Sigma}(x_1 x_2 x_2 x_3)` 
                    is regular.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Decision Problems</u>
                <p>The following problems are decidable for `\text{nePAT}\Sigma` and `ePAT\Sigma`, 
                    where `\Sigma` is any finite alphabet:<br/>

                    for `\text{nePAT}\Sigma` and for `ePAT\Sigma` is undecidable.<br/>
                    A sufficient condition for the inclusion is known:<br/>

                    If `\varphi` additionally is non-erasing, then `L_{NE,\Sigma}(\alpha) \subseteq L_{NE,\Sigma}(\beta)`.</p>

                <u>Equivalence Problem</u>
                <p>For NE-pattern languages, the equivalence problem is not hard to solve:<br/>
                    Let `\Sigma` be an alphabet, `|\Sigma| \geq 2`, and let `\alpha, \beta \in (\Sigma \cup X)^+`. 
                    `L_{NE,\Sigma}(\alpha) = L_{NE,\Sigma}(\beta)` if and only if `\alpha` and `\beta` 
                    are identical (up to are naming of variables).<br/>
                    Corollary - Let `\Sigma` be an alphabet, `|\Sigma| \geq 2`. The equivalence

                    `\text{nePAT}\Sigma` is decidable in O(n).<br/>
                    For E-Pattern languages, the equivalence problem is open.<br/>
                    Conjecture - Let `\Sigma` be an alphabet, `|\Sigma| \geq 3`, and let `\alpha, \beta \in (\Sigma \cup X)^\ast`.

                    This conjecture is (at least partly) incorrect:<br/>

                <u>Further Properties</u>
                <p>As seen for some of the above questions, the properties of pattern languages 
                    can depend on the size of the alphabet `\Sigma`. This is a rare phenomenon in 
                    formal language theory, where normally a type of languages has the same 
                    properties for all alphabets with at least two letters.<br/>Due to their 
                    simple definition, pattern languages are closely connected to a large number 
                    of other important concepts in theoretical computer science and discrete 
                    mathematics. This holds for equality sets, word equations and avoidable 
                    patterns.</p>

                <u>Finding Patterns Common to a Set of Words</u>
                <p>Pattern languages are mainly used in bio-informatics and data mining, where it 
                    is the task to find and describe commonalities of some given words. The 
                    corresponding theory is then depending on the actual parameters of this task, 
                    called<br/>
                    . Pattern discovery<br/>
                    . Algorithmic learning of patterns<br/>
                    However the practical applicability of pattern languages still suffers from 
                    our lack of understanding of of their properties.<br/>
                    Due to their manifold connections to other concepts, pattern languages are 
                    also used to gain a deeper understanding of other fields of study.</p>

                <u>A Simple Controller</u>
                <p>Behaviour of a keypad with keys a, b, c, d and valid code cdda:<br/>
                    <img src='Formal Languages & the Theory of Computation/Image1.jpg' alt='First Image'><br/>
                    The symbol $\lozenge$ indicates 'no input' for more than n seconds, and<br/>
                    in state `q_4` the controller unlocks the door</p>
                <br/>
                <u>The Connection to Formal Language Theory</u>
                <p>The behaviour of this computational device is completely described by the set 
                    of all sequences of keypad inputs that make the controller move from the 
                    initial state `q_0` to its final state `q_4`.<br/>
                    In this view, our controller accepts the language $(a | b | c | d | \lozenge)^\ast \cdot \text{cdda}$.<br/>
                    In language theory, such a controller is called a finite automaton. It is 
                    considered to be a device that consists of:<br/>
                    . An unbounded input tape<br/>
                    . An input head which scans this tape letter by letter<br/>
                    . A finite set of states<br/>
                    A finite state control determining the next state based on the current state 
                    and the letter currently read by the input head.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Deterministic Finite Automata</u>
                <p>A deterministic finite automaton (DFA) A is a tuple `A = (Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)`
                    satisfying the following conditions:<br/>
                    . Q is a finite set of states<br/>
                    . `\Sigma` is a finite alphabet of input symbols<br/>
                    . `\delta : (Q \times \Sigma) \rightarrow Q`  is a transition function<br/>
                    . `q_o \in Q` is a start state<br/>
                    . `F \subseteq Q` is a set of accepting states<br/>
                    We normally assume the transition function to be total.<br/>However, for 
                    certain automata, this requirement is unessential.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>The Language Accepted by a DFA</u>
                <p>We extend the transition function such that it does not deal with single 
                    letters, but with arbitrary words over `\Sigma` as an input:<br/>
                    Let `A = (Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)` be a DFA. We inductively define the 
                    function $\delta\text^ : (Q \times \Sigma^\ast) \rightarrow Q$ by, for 
                    every `q \in Q, a \in \Sigma, v \in \Sigma^\ast`,<br/>
                    $\delta\text^(q, \epsilon) = q$,<br/>
                    $\delta\text^(q, av) = \delta\text^(\delta(q, a), v)$.<br/>
                    Let `A = (Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)` be a DFA. A accepts the following 
                    language: $L(A) := {w \in \Sigma^\ast | \delta\text^(q_0, w) \in F}$.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Transition Diagrams</u>
                <p>A graph as used for our initial keypad controller is called a transition 
                    diagram. For `A_{3mod4}`, it looks as follows<br/>
                    <img src='Formal Languages & the Theory of Computation/Image2.jpg' alt='Second Image'><br/>
                    The unlabeled arrow indicates the start state, a double circle stands for an 
                    accepting state.<br/>Every DFA can be given as a transition diagram.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Transition Tables</u>
                <p>Alternatively, we can define `A_{3mod4} using a so-called transition table:<br/>
                    <img src='Formal Languages & the Theory of Computation/Image3.jpg' alt='Third Image'><br/>
                    The arrow indicates the start state, an asterisk * highlights an accepting 
                    state.<br/>Every DFA can be given a transition table.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Expressive Power</u>
                <p>Let `\texti L_{DFA}` be the class of all languages accepted by DFA. Then 
                    `\texti L_{DFA} = REG`.<br/>On the one hand, DFA read a word from the left 
                    to the right, and they can only apply a finite set of states when doing this; 
                    thus, it is not surprising that their expressive power equals that of Type 3 
                    grammars.<br/>On the other hand, DFA are deterministic, while Type 3 grammars 
                    and regular expressions are nondeterministic. In this regard, it might seem a 
                    bit counter intuitive that DFA are as powerful as the nondeterministic 
                    generators of regular languages.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Further Properties</u>
                <p>Since DFA exactly accept the regular languages, their decision problems have 
                    the same desirable properties as the Type 3 grammars. In particular, their 
                    membership problem is not only decidable, but in time O(n), since, for every 
                    word, there is exactly one computation.<br/>A closer look at the properties of 
                    transition diagrams gives a very clear idea of why the Pumping Lemma is 
                    correct: In an infinite regular language, all words from a certain length 
                    onwards can only be accepted by passing a circle in the transition diagram. It 
                    must then be possible to pass this circle arbitrarily many times.</p>

                <u>Nondeterministic Finite Automata</u>
                <p>Let S be a set. The P(S) denotes the power set of S, i.e., the set of all 
                    subsets of S.<br/>A nondeterministic finite automaton is a tuple 
                    `A = (Q, \Sigma, \delta, S, F)`  satisfying the following conditions:<br/>
                    . Q is a finite set of states.<br/>
                    . `\Sigma` is a finite alphabet of input symbols.<br/>
                    . `\delta : (Q \times \Sigma) \rightarrow P(Q)` is a transition relation.<br/>
                    . `S \subseteq Q` is a set of start states.<br/>
                    . `F \subseteq Q` is a set of accepting states</p>
                <br/>
                <u>The Languages Accepted by an NFA</u>
                <p>Let `A = (Q, \Sigma, \delta, S, F)` be an NFA. We inductively define the 
                    function `\delta\text{^} : (P(Q) \times \Sigma^\ast) \rightarrow P(Q)` by, for 
                    every `Q' \subseteq Q, a \in \Sigma, v \in \Sigma^\ast`,<br/>
                    `\delta\text{^}(Q', \epsilon) = Q', \delta\text{^}(Q', av) = \cup vq \in Q' \delta\text{^}(\delta(q, a), v)`.<br/>
                    Let `A = (Q, \Sigma, \delta, S, F)` be an NFA. A accepts the following 
                    language:<br/>
                    `L(A) := {w \in \Sigma^\ast | \delta\text{^}(S, w) \cap F \ne \emptyset}`.</p>
