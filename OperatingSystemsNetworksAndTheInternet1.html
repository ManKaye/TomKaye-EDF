                <p>Operating System - A program that acts as an intermediary between the user and
                    the computer hardware.<br/>
                    A typical operating system has the following components:<br/>
                    . Users<br/>
                    . Application Programs<br/>
                    . The Operating System<br/>
                    . Computer Hardware<br/>
                    Open-Source operating systems are made freely available in source code format,
                    rather than as compiled binary code.<br/>Closed-Source provide binary
                    executables instead of source code.<br/>The computer hardware is mainly made up
                    of the CPU (Central Processing Unit), the Memory and the I/O (Input/output
                    devices).<br/>For this module, only a computer with a single processor, a
                    shared memory and some connected peripherals is considered.<br/>
                    An operating system hopes to achieve three objectives in its design:<br/>
                    . Convenience<br/>
                    . Efficiency<br/>
                    . Ability to Evolve<br/>
                    An operating system is both a resource allocator and a control program.<br/>
                    Resource Allocator - The computer has several resources which may be required
                    to solve a problem: CPU time, memory space, file-storage space, I/O devices,
                    etc. The operating system among programs and users efficiently and fairly.<br/>
                    Control Program - A control program manages the execution of user programs to
                    prevent errors and improper use of the various I/O (Input/Output) devices and
                    user programs. It aims to protect the computer resources and application
                    programs from each other.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Multiprogramming</u>
                <p>Multiprogramming allows the sharing of a processor and is needed for efficiency.
                    It allows for the organization of jobs for the CPU to execute, a subset of all
                    the available jobs in the memory, and a job which is currently selected to be
                    executed.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Multitasking</u>
                <p>Multitasking is an extension of multiprogramming. The idea is to execute
                    multiple jobs by cycling through them very quickly. This gives the appearance
                    that they are all running at the same time, even though only one program is
                    running at any time. It often is used in interactive systems with several
                    users. The user appears to have the sole use of the computer being shared also
                    known as a time-sharing system.<br/>In Layman's terms, the comparison between
                    multiprogramming and multitasking is that multiprogramming assigns a program to
                    the CPU through the users switching of programs. Multitasking keeps all
                    programs open by regularly updating each program.<br/>The processor also needs
                    protecting in order to avoid programs crashing the entire system. This is where
                    interrupts come into play.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Interrupts</u>
                <p>An interrupt tells the operating system that an event has occurred like an
                    infinite loop that needs to be dealt with to prevent a crash.<br/>Hardware
                    interrupts are asynchronous and come directly from the system devices. The
                    system timer is an example of one of these interrupts.<br/>Software or program
                    interrupts are triggered by software when attempting to run an illegal
                    operation for example. Program interrupts are sometimes called traps. System
                    calls can be used to request special system operations that user programs are
                    not usually allowed to access.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Memory Sharing</u>
                <p>The various users and application programs must all share the limited resources
                    of registers, cache, main memory and disc space. Applications should be
                    protected from each other so that one program cannot change the data of another
                    without authorization.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Memory Manager</u>
                <p>This software chooses what pieces of data to pass onto the CPU to allocate it to
                    the memory mapper.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Memory Mapper</u>
                <p>This software maps where the blocks of data for a program are going to go. If
                    the block of data will not fill in the gap because it is too big, then it
                    cannot be mapped.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Peripherals</u>
                <p>Shareable Devices are devices that can be shared between users like the hard
                    disk for example.<br/>Non-shareable Devices are devices that cannot be shared,
                    like a printer where only one document can be printed at any time.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Protection of Resources</u>
                <p>Protection of resources requires the knowledge of whether the processor is
                    running user code or operating system code.<br/>User state has limited access
                    to the instruction set, memory and peripherals.<br/>Special state has
                    unrestricted access to the instruction set, memory and the peripherals.<br/>
                    There are some system instructions that are privileged like I/O calls, timer
                    management or switching, etc.<br/>There are two types of special states:
                    interruptible special states (supervisor states) and non-interruptible special
                    states (Kernel states)</p>
                <br/>
                <u>System Calls</u>
                <p>System Call - The mechanism used to allow user programs to convey their
                    requirements to the operating system.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Memory Sharing</u>
                <p>Multiple users must share the RAM which has very limited memory. The data used
                    by the RAM should be protected so that one program can't alter the contents of
                    another program without authorization.<br/>
                    Real Address = Base Address + Virtual Address<br/>Programs use virtual
                    addresses and memory uses the real addresses. A hardware device automatically
                    adds the base address to the virtual address, thus creating the real address
                    in the main memory.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Base-limit Addressing</u>
                <p>Each program's memory space should be separate. Each program can only access
                    legal addresses. This functionality is achieved by two values - base value and
                    limit value.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>MMU (Memory-management Unit)</u>
                <p>The memory management unit maps in run-time virtual to real addresses. It also
                    checks accesses to memory are valid.<br/>The base value of a program is stored
                    in the base register.<br/>The limit value is stored in the limit register.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Memory Management</u>
                <p>First Fit - Place the new program in the first large enough position in the
                    memory.<br/>
                    Best Fit - Place the new program in the smallest hole large enough to hold the
                    program.<br/>
                    Worst Fit - Place the new program in the largest available hole.<br/>
                    Sometimes there isn't a memory area big enough to accommodate a new program.
                    In this case there are two options - compaction and swapping.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Compaction</u>
                <p>When there are multiple holes in the memory, it is referred to as
                    fragmentation. A solution to this is compaction, which converts all the
                    current programs in the memory to form one memory block, still split but
                    without the intermittent holes, which will now be at the tail of the memory.
                    This can be an expensive operation to do.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Swapping</u>
                <p>Another alternative of further memory management is swapping, which will swap
                    an existent program that isn't currently being used and replace it with a
                    program that needs to be used currently. The previous program can be resumed
                    by swapping again.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Segmentation</u>
                <p>In segmentation, a program is split up into segments, a segment will be a
                    logical unit like a main program, a procedure, a method, an object, local
                    variables, arrays, etc.<br/>The advantage of segmentation is that a program
                    can run even if it doesn't have all of its segments in the real memory. Each
                    program will have a segment table. The segment table tells us information
                    about each segment of a particular program like whether that given segment is
                    in the main memory, its real memory address and how large the segment is.<br/>
                    There are three accesses to a segment: The read access, the write access and
                    the execute access. The read access governs whether the user can see the data.
                    The write access governs whether the data can be edited by that user. The
                    execute access governs whether that user can run the program.<br/>Program
                    instructions are of execute access, constants are of read access and variables
                    are of read and write access.<br/>The code can be shared is the segment can be
                    shared by two programs or more.<br/>
                    <img src="Operating Systems, Networks & the Internet 1/Image1.jpg" alt="First Image" style="max-width: 100%;"></p>
                <br/>
                <u>Paging</u>
                <p>Pages are similar but also different to segments. They are small pieces of data
                    from a program like a segment but they are of a fixed size, normally 1KB., a
                    lot smaller than a segment. A page can have a combination of program
                    instruction, constant or variable words. Under paging there are two virtual
                    addresses, the virtual page number and the offset into that page. Since the
                    page size is a power of two, this means that the virtual address consists of
                    some number of bits for the offset and some number of bits for the page
                    number. To convert between virtual and real addresses the page table replaces
                    the virtual page number with the real page number. The pages, like segments
                    can be loaded into the real memory in any order and also, like segments
                    doesn't have to load all the pages of a program at once, as new parts of the
                    program are required, the new pages are loaded.<br/>Physical memory is divided
                    into frames of fixed-sized blocks and the logical memory is divided into pages
                    of fixed-sized blocks.<br/>
                    <img src="Operating Systems, Networks & the Internet 1/Image2.jpg" alt="Second Image" style="max-width: 100%;"><br/>
                    A combination of both segmentation and paging is often used is real life
                    system. This helps avoid the disadvantages of each method but requires more
                    hardware support.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>The Process Scheduler</u>
                <p>The process scheduler is a hardware tool used to decide which process or
                    program should currently be running. The set of all the processes in the
                    system is called the job queue. The set of processes in the RAM that are
                    readily being used is called the ready queue. The scheduler will change jobs
                    frequently sometimes and thus decides which job is best to run next. Programs
                    can have three different states in the process scheduler: running, runnable or
                    blocked. Running means that the program is currently being used in the RAM. A
                    runnable program is a program that is able to run if the user requests it. A
                    blocked program is a program that is unable to run at the current time for
                    some reason. Once a program is no longer blocked by the process scheduler it
                    will return to the state of runnable until it is selected to be used by the
                    user or it breaks and is blocked again. A runnable program cannot be blocked,
                    only running programs can crash as they are operating and become blocked by
                    the process scheduler. A running program can also become runnable if the
                    program works fine through its execution and to the point of the process
                    scheduler switching processes.<br/>In a list, the process scheduler will be
                    scanning from top to bottom for the first runnable list to be run. If there is
                    a process at the top of the list that is blocked, the next process below,
                    which is runnable, will be changed to running.<br/>
                    Round-robin Scheduling involves the process scheduler periodically analyze
                    each program in the scheduler to see whether the running state of that program
                    has changed. The running program is run by the scheduler simply knowing the
                    pointer that points to the running program and keeps it running each time it
                    loops until the user changes the running program.<br/>
                    Priority Scheduling involves the process scheduler choosing the program with
                    the highest priority value. To achieve a priority values, the process
                    scheduler has a new data value in the virtual table called priority. The
                    highest priority value will be the lowest number in this case. As a new
                    process enters the queue, it's priority value is checked and it is appended to
                    the appropriate level of the queue priority-wise. Process priorities could be
                    altered in the sense that a number is given to new processes entering the
                    queue that may be lower for new processes, simulating a queue data structure.
                    It could be higher, simulating a stack. It could be based on the user using
                    the process in that particular network.<br/>Priority and round-robin
                    scheduling could be hybridized, implementing variables instead of constants to
                    the priority column. The process scheduler could periodically check the
                    priority column to see whether the variable values have changed.<br/>Long-term
                    Priority Scheduling is another form of priority scheduling that uses some sort
                    of formula to automate the number assigning job in the process scheduler in a
                    particular way. After the formulation has been completed, the queue must be
                    sorted again.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>CPU & I/O Bound Programs</u>
                <p>Programs that are children of a device like a printer, a mouse, a keyboard or a
                    camera, as well as other I/O devices will be I/O-bound programs. These
                    programs will consume a small amount of time and memory in their execution.<br/>
                    Programs that are children of the CPU, these processes handle no conversion and
                    take place on a solely software point-of-view, rarely interacting with any I/O
                    devices in terms of primary functionality. These programs require large amounts
                    of time and memory for them to run.<br/>I/O-bound programs are normally given
                    priority to get them out of the way with so the larger programs can run for a
                    longer amount of time.<br/>There has been shown to be an alternating sequence
                    between CPU and I/O bursts in a process scheduler where a program will
                    periodically send instructions to I/O devices or the CPU.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Device Controllers</u>
                <p>Devices connected to a computer need to be managed for the computer to work
                    without any faults or crashes. To achieve this, device controllers are sited
                    on the bus line running from each peripheral I/O device. They are pieces of
                    hardware consisting of electronics, and sets of instructions and Boolean
                    values for whether the device is ready to receive information or not, whether
                    it condones with synchronous data transmission.<br/>Device handlers can be
                    character-stream or block. Character-stream device handlers will send and
                    receive data byte by byte and block device handlers will send and receive data
                    in blocks of bytes at a time.<br/>Device handlers can be sequential access or
                    random access. Sequential access will get data sequentially, so in an order
                    and random access will access data at random points at the computer's
                    execution.<br/>Device handlers can be asynchronous or synchronous in their
                    data transmission methods. An asynchronous data transmission system will send
                    data when it needs to without request and an synchronous data transmission
                    system will send and receive data by requesting to send data and confirming
                    sending of data.<br/>Device handlers can also be RO, WO or R/W. Read-only
                    memory means that the device can only read data, write-only means that the
                    device can only write data and read/write data means that the device can read
                    and write data.<br/>Device handlers can also have latency, seek time and
                    transfer rate levels. Latency describes the lost time from sending or
                    receiving any data, seek time is the time it takes for the device to find the
                    data it needs to read or write to and transfer rate is the time it takes for
                    data to be received on both ends.<br/>Device handlers can also be sharable or
                    non-sharable. Sharable device handlers can be accessed by multiple other
                    devices at the same time. Non-sharable device handlers can only be accessed by
                    one other device at any one time. An example of a sharable device would be a
                    hard disk.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Direct-memory Access</u>
                <p>To transfer large amount of data to a device, DMA will be needed. It unburdens
                    the CPU from taking up the tasks of the devices as well as all the programs it
                    has to run. It will map device instructions with the main memory.<br/>Sharable
                    devices have request queues that will handle the demand of that device from
                    other devices that are a part of the computer. When another device wants data
                    from this sharable device, the device will request the data. After the command
                    has been put through the request queue that has been initialized, then the
                    device will send the data to the other device if it is ready while sending an
                    interrupt to the request queue so it can restart.<br/>Non-sharable devices
                    will have request receivers instead of queues. These pieces of software will
                    wait for a request and then run the data transmission protocol. Once the data
                    has been sent from the device successfully, it will then send the interrupt to
                    the request receiver to tell it that the task has been completed.<br/>Spooling
                    is a process where the data of a request from a device is put in a disk until
                    the other device becomes free and can process the other data. It acts as a
                    buffer.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Files & Filing Systems</u>
                <p>The contents of files in programs and system files does not matter when storing
                    that file in a hard disk or any other place of storage.<br/>A filing system
                    will change that, adding sorting systems to any data leaving or entering the
                    hard disk. The disk will be partitioned into several different parts where
                    files are categorized so it is easier to find them in the future.<br/>
                    Therefore, a file is a collection of data items and a filing system is a piece
                    of software used to manage the contents of storage devices.<br/>Directories
                    are the main components to filing. They help keep files organized in programs
                    and also hold specific information for a collection of certain files. They
                    will hold the name of the file, the identification of the file's owner, the
                    size of the file, dates and times, protection details and retrieval
                    information.<br/>
                    Single-level Filing System - A filing system with only one level of
                    directories. This means that all files of a program are stored in one
                    directory.<br/>The MFD will store the information of all the files on a hard
                    disk.<br/>In a single-level filing system, the files will all be one level
                    below the MFD of that hard disk.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>FAT (File Allocation Table)</u>
                <p>File allocation tables are storage methods of hard disks that involve dividing
                    the hard disk into clusters. The cluster allocation for any file will be
                    located in the FAT value.<br/>
                    $\textit{The Size of a Cluster} = \frac{\textit{The Storage Size of the Disk}}{The Number of Clusters}$<br/>
                    FAT16 will split the hard disk into $2^{16}$ clusters and FAT32 will split the hard disk into
                    $2^{32}$ clusters. The file that needs to be stored on a FAT disk will be put in several
                    different clusters depending on that file's size. The directory entry will hold the first
                    cluster of the file. The first cluster of the file will then point to the second cluster of
                    the file, and that will happen until all the clusters of the file have been accounted for. A
                    value of -1 in the pointer of the final cluster will complete the chain of clusters associated
                    with one file.<br/>The FAT will be stored in the main memory of the computer.<br/>
                    Two-Level Filing System - A filing system that has two directories for two
                    users, each containing files belonging to that user.<br/>The UFD will store
                    the information of all the files on the hard disk that belong or are shared
                    with that user.<br/>In a two-level filing system, the files will be two levels
                    below the MFD and one level below the UFD's.<br/>It is efficient to be able to
                    only search the user's directory when a file from that user is required. The
                    same file name can also be used across multiple user's directories.<br/>
                    Multi-level Filing System - A filing system where any node can either be a
                    file or a directory. This is equivalent to the modern day operating systems
                    features like Windows, where Windows Explorer is an example.<br/>There is no
                    limit to the number of levels in the hard disks architecture.<br/>
                    Single-filing systems are best used for networks with only one user. These
                    systems offer no level of protection from data.<br/>Two-level filing systems
                    are best used for multi-user system management and there is implicit effective
                    protection of data offered with these systems. With a two-level system, each
                    user has access only to their own directory. They will have to enter a
                    username and password to gain access to them. The username and password access
                    is secure but not flexible.<br/>Multi-level filing systems are best to help
                    users organize their work. These systems are flexible in their protection
                    levels.<br/>(r, w, x - read, write, and execute) are all values of files and
                    directories in a hard disk. Both files and directories are readable, writable
                    and executable.<br/>Users will need access rights to every branch down to a
                    file.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Performance</u>
                <p>Disk access is much slower than memory access. The aim is to reduce the number
                    of disk accesses as it will be slowing up the computer with higher amount of
                    disk accesses.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Cache</u>
                <p>Caches are a section of small amounts of memory in the main memory, accept the
                    cache is located closer to the CPU, to provide faster performance. Caches are
                    a form of fast memory that contain copies of data.<br/>The first time a piece
                    of data is loaded it would be slow as the CPU is requesting data that isn't
                    yet loaded in the cache, so the first operation is to copy the data from the
                    disk memory to the cache. From there, the cache sends the data to the
                    equivalent program in the main memory.<br/>Caches have limited storage space
                    and the cache size and data replacement rate must be chosen carefully
                    according to the system. Disk caches are also available to store the most
                    frequently used files in the hard disk.<br/>A synchronous cache write will
                    make the program wait until the piece of data has been written to the hard
                    disk.<br/>An asynchronous cache write will send a confirmation signal to the
                    program when the data is in the cache and will write the data to the hard disk
                    when convenient.<br/>For large transfers, output is far more efficient than
                    input in a disk. The user process sees very fast writes in particular.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Recovery</u>
                <p>Computer crashes can happen anytime and if it results in the computer being
                    turned off, all the data in the RAM will be lost. If the data in the main
                    memory and the cache hasn't been updated to the hard disk during the program's
                    running, then that data will be lost forever. This is known as
                    inconsistency.<br/>A consistency checker will analyze the data in directories
                    of a system and the data in blocks on the hard disk. It will try and fix any
                    inconsistencies it finds. If an inconsistency is irreparable then human
                    intervention is required to fix the problem.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Journaling</u>
                <p>In this case, all changes to data that need to make in the queue of the main
                    memory will be kept in a log, that is written to sequentially. In the
                    situation of a system crash, a log will be able to load the instructions back
                    into the CPU so those changes in data can still be made, even after a
                    crash.<br/>Journaling can be useful for the file allocation table, where
                    inconsistencies can cause serious system failures. This will have an impact on
                    performance as journaling requires all instruction data to be duplicated.<br/>
                    Each set of operations that complete a certain task is called a transaction. A
                    transaction can be considered to be completed if the changed data is found in
                    the logs on the hard disk.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Sequential I/O vs. Random I/O</u>
                <p>The costly synchronous random data writes are turned into much less costly
                    synchronous sequential data writes to the log. Those changes are replayed
                    asynchronously through random disk writes.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Backup & Restore</u>
                <p>Magnetic disks can sometimes fail and data can be lost. This is where backing
                    up data can be useful as it duplicates all data currently on the internal hard
                    disk, to another external hard disk so if the internal hard disk fails, a new
                    one can be bought and the backup can be put on the hard disk.<br/>There are
                    two ways to copy these large amounts of data; full back-up or incremental
                    back-up, full back-up will write all the data in the hard disk to the external
                    hard disk, while an incremental back-up will write only the altered data to a
                    hard disk. It is best to do multiple back-ups in the order of a full back-up,
                    followed by n-1 incremental back-ups, then finally on the nth time, do one
                    final full back-up.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Process</u>
                <p>A process is a program in execution. It is actually more than a program's code
                    data, it also holds program counters and stacks, etc. Without these additional
                    features, a program cannot become a process.<br/>A process is generally
                    running any program with a giving starting data set.<br/>Two processes may use
                    the same program if both processes require data to be written or read using
                    that program.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Process Concept</u>
                <p>A process needs a process state, a program counter, CPU registers, CPU
                    scheduling information, memory-management information, accounting information
                    and I/O status information.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Process Control Block</u>
                <p>A process control block is a data block that will contain information for a
                    process, just like the aspects shown above, as well as the process number and
                    the list of open files.<br/>In the task of switching between processes, the
                    CPU will run into an interrupt or a system call and the first PCB will be
                    saved according to how it ended up at the end of running, then the updated PCB
                    of the other process is reloaded into the operating system. Another interrupt
                    or system call is then issued to trigger another process switch where the same
                    string of events will take place.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Context Switch</u>
                <p>A context switch stores and restores the state of the CPU so that multiple
                    resources can share the same processes. With a context switch, no procedures
                    will take place while the switch is taking place.<br/>Context switch time
                    depends on hardware support and the memory management method. The more
                    complicated an operating system, the more work must be done to switch
                    processes.<br/>Context switching can cause a performance bottleneck, to
                    resolve this there are alternative methods of switching processes like using
                    threading. Threads are created in a process that contain data. They all share
                    memory and code. Threads can be changed very quickly to simulate concurrency.
                    High core CPUs can achieve concurrency.<br/>Multithreading will allow for
                    multiple threads to be sent at once to the main memory. Single core threading
                    will queue threads and send them one at a time. Multithreading on a multi-core
                    CPU will hybridize both forms of threading, creating two queues, sending
                    threads at the same time.<br/>Multi-threading has higher performance, better
                    responsiveness, reduced resources and economy, parallelization, resource
                    sharing, and scalability.<br/>With a system with a multicore. Multithreading
                    can run where multiple threads can be sent at once and as such some things
                    should be covered like dividing activities, balance, data splitting, data
                    dependency, testing and debugging.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Cooperating Process</u>
                <p>A process is cooperating if it can affect or be affected by other processes. If
                    it doesn't do this then it is an independent process. Process cooperation is
                    good for breaking up large tasks into smaller sub-tasks, running all the
                    sub-tasks potentially simultaneously and speeding up performance. It also
                    allows for the system to be structured in a modular fashion as well as a user
                    being able to work on multiple tasks at any one time on an operating system.<br/>
                    The producer-consumer problem is a common problem relating to cooperating
                    processes. There are often processes that are creating data and some processes
                    that are taking data. The creators are the producers and the takers are the
                    consumers. If one process is producing or taking too much  data there will be a
                    bias in polarity of actions in both the cooperating processes.<br/>To solve
                    these issues, the producer should not continue to produce data after the data
                    buffer for the customer process is full. The customer process should also not
                    try to take data that doesn’t exist in an empty data buffer of the producer
                    process.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Synchronization</u>
                <p>A semaphore is a hardware or software flag. It is a value that describes the
                    state of the common resource. It is used to lock the resource in some way.<br/>
                    A process needing the resource will check the semaphores status to see if it
                    is locked or not.<br/>A semaphore has two operations, the V-operation and the
                    P-operation. The P-operation, the test option, will see if the resource is
                    free and if it isn't then it will be locked. If it is free then it will enter
                    the resource and then leave, securing the lock. If it is locked, then it will
                    wait until the resource becomes unlocked to access it and then lock itself out
                    afterwards. The V-operation, the free option, will unlock a resource for use.
                    It will also alert any processes wanting to use the resource that were
                    waiting.<br/>Semaphores should be locked and unlocked to prevent a process
                    from getting too far ahead and potentially causing a crash for itself or
                    another process.<br/>If there are two processes, trying to access one
                    resource, a bucket for example, then the two processes full bucket and empty
                    bucket will have to have opposite semaphore states attached to them. In this
                    case, if the empty bucket is free, then the full bucket must be locked as a
                    bucket cannot be both empty and full at the same time.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>The Internet</u>
                <p>The Internet includes millions of connected computing devices, (end systems)
                    that make up a mesh network topology. The routers will forward the packets to
                    the destination IP address while the protocols control the sending and
                    receiving of messages. In a sense the Internet is a network of networks.<br/>
                    The infrastructure of the Internet provides services to distributed
                    applications like the web, e-mail, games, e-commerce, etc.<br/>The
                    connectionless transmission will be unreliable and the connection-oriented
                    transmission is reliable.<br/>The transportation of data from a university to
                    another website will be $\text{End-system}\rightarrow \text{Ethernet port}\rightarrow \text{Hub}\rightarrow \text{Switch}\rightarrow$$\text{Gigabit switch}\rightarrow \text{Hall link}\rightarrow \text{Campus switching}\rightarrow$<br/>

                <br/>
                <u>Network Types</u>
                <p>There are size-based networks like PAN, LAN, MAN, and WAN, (local, wide area
                    networks).<br/>Networks can be defined by the operating system like Novell,
                    Microsfot or UNIX.<br/>The network can be defined by its used like for staff
                    or students.<br/>Networks are comprise of workstations where the end-user
                    systems will be, the servers and the network modem, hubs, witches and
                    routers.<br/>LAN - A  local area network interconnects a variety of data
                    communicating devices within a small geographic area. LAN networks will use
                    high data transfer rates with very low error rates.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Network Topologies</u>
                <p>Ring Topology - All computers in a network are connected via  ring of cables.
                    The pro of this method is that there is equal sharing between all the
                    computers in question. The con is that a break in the ring will cause the
                    whole system to fail. Nodes will only be able to send data once they capture
                    the token.<br/>
                    Bus Technology - All computers in a network are connected to one 'main road'
                    that is a bus, running through every computer, but unlike the ring topology,
                    it isn't cyclic. Bus topologies are easy to install but unfortunately the
                    nodes must actually contend against one another to access the network. There
                    is therefore no guarantee of data access at any time.<br/>
                    Star Topology - All but one computer in the network are connected to that one
                    central server computer that acts as the manager of all the end-systems. Nodes
                    can be connected to a star network with ease as well as having the feature
                    that if one node on the topology fails, none of the other nodes should fail.
                    However, the one problem is that is the central server computer fails then all
                    the node computers will also fail in the network.<br/>
                    There are also mesh, fully connected, line and tree network topologies. Line
                    topologies are like bus topologies accept the data has to go through the
                    computer in a line topology and has an option to branch off in a bus topology.
                    A mesh topology is a network where one node can be connected to n other nodes,
                    with no particular requirements, with enough connections, any node can connect
                    to any other node in a mesh topology, hopefully in less time than another
                    network, unless maybe a star network. An extension to the mesh topology is the
                    fully connected topology which had a node connect to n other nodes where n is
                    the number of nodes in the network. A tree network is where the root node
                    connects all the other nodes in the network and slowly, as the trees is
                    descended there will be less important computers that control less and less
                    other computers until the bottom of the tree is reached and the end-systems
                    are found.<br/>
                    MAN networks, (Metropolitan Area Networks) are large networks that would span
                    more than a LAN, like a city but less than a WAN where a whole region or even
                    country can be covered. The MAN networks will typically use the wireless
                    infrastructure to connect to their sites. They have high transfer speeds and
                    can recover from network faults very quickly. They are often a ring topology
                    and some can be provisioned dynamically.<br/>
                    WAN networks, (Wide Area Networks) are huge networks that cover broad
                    geographical areas. The most well-known example will be the Internet. WANs
                    used to be associated with slow and noisy lines but today are characterized by
                    very high speed data transfer rates and very low error occurrence rates. WANs
                    often follow the mesh topology.<br/>There are three types of communication for
                    networks, unicast, broadcast and multicast. A unicast will simply have a
                    single sender and a single receiver. A broadcast will have one sender and n-1
                    receivers where n is the number of nodes on the network. A multicast
                    communication will be between 1 sender and 1 to n-2 nodes connected to it.<br/>
                    There are three main aspects to a network in terms of structure, the edge, the
                    core and the communication links by access networks.<br/>The network edge
                    includes all the hosts of the network, the client/server model and the
                    peer-to-peer model. The client-server models are the Internet and e-mails and
                    such. The peer-to-peer models are the systems with no dedicated servers like
                    Skype or Bittorrent.<br/>he network core is the mesh of all the routers of a
                    network that allow the interconnection of all the networks's end systems.<br/>
                    The communication links are the form of transmission wirelessly, the bandwidth
                    and the access rates of different bodies using the network. The wireless
                    connection methods include radio, satellite and fibreoptic.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Protocols</u>
                <p>Protocols are a set of rules that users have to follow in a system. Depending
                    on how the string of events turns out, the output from the protocol might be
                    different.<br/>There are many network protocols that define how certain data
                    transmission methods work like TCP, UDP, SMTP etc.<br/>A protocol defines the
                    format and the order of messages exchanged between two or more communicating
                    entities as well as the actions taken on the transmission and/or receipt of a
                    message or other event.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Layering Networks</u>
                <p>There are two main ways to layer network protocols. One is the OSI reference
                    model and the other is the TCP/IP reference model.<br/>The OSI reference model
                    has an application, presentation, session, transport, network, data link and
                    physical layer in it. The application layer is the main interface for the
                    users to interact with the application. The presentation layer transforms the
                    data into an interface for the Application layer. The session layer is
                    responsible for establishing sessions between users. The transport layer
                    provides end-to-end error-free network connection between these two users. The
                    network layer is responsible for maintaining and ending network connections.
                    The data link layer is responsible for taking data and transforming it into a
                    frame with a header, control and address information as well as error
                    detection code. The physical layer is the handling of the transmission of bits
                    over a communication channel including the voltage levels, the connectors, the
                    media choice, etc.<br/>The TCP/IP protocol has an application layer, a
                    transport layer, a network layer and a network access layer.<br/>The OSI
                    reference model has bad implementation and politics and the TCP/IP protocol is
                    not a general model, the last layer isn't really a proper layer and there are
                    not physical and data link layers.<br/>A hybrid model has an application
                    layer, a transport layer, a network layer, a data link layer and a physical
                    layer.<br/>The application layer in the hybrid model controls the protocols
                    that define the formatting. The transport layer processes data transfer like
                    TCP or UDP. The network layer is the routing of the datagrams from source to
                    destination. The link layer transfers data between neighbouring network
                    elements. The physical layer controls the bits on the wire.<br/>A router will
                    run on a three-level OSI reference model which has a network, link and
                    physical layer</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Application Layer</u>
                <p>The application layer supports network applications like HTTP, SMTP, FTP and
                    others. It will perform common application services for the application
                    processes.<br/>
                    Process - A program running within a host.<br/>Within the same host, two
                    processes communicate using inter-process communication. Processes in
                    different hosts will communicate by exchanging messages.<br/>The client
                    process - a process that initiates communication.<br/>The server process - a
                    process that waits to be contacted.<br/>An application Programming Interface
                    lies between the application layer and the transport layer within a host. It
                    provides programming abstraction for processes communicating over a network.
                    Each socket will have an address and a port.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Sockets</u>
                <p>Process sends/receives messages to/from its socket. A socket will be analogous
                    to a door in this sense as the socket essentially is the gateway from the
                    application to the transportation phase of sending the message.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Addressing Process</u>
                <p>An IP address of 32 bits, uniquely identifies any host. In this sense, the
                    sending process must identify the receiving process.<br/>There are also port
                    numbers associated with the identifier that identifies the network application
                    with the process on the host computer.<br/>A port number is a 16 bit value. It
                    is a sub-address within a host and can only have one per host. HTTP is 80 for
                    example and SMTP is 25.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Ports</u>
                <p>A server port is fixed and well known.<br/>The name of an address involves a
                    one-to-one mapping to an IP address.<br/>The IP address is 32 bits in the form
                    x.x.x.x, the port number is a 16 bit value with a range from 0-65535 and port
                    numbers from 0-1023</p>
                <br/>
                <u>A Client Wanting to Visit the Internet</u>
                <p>The client will send a request of source: x.x.x.x and a port number of P and a
                    destination: y.y.y.y and a port number of 80.<br/>The response will be a
                    source: y.y.y.y and a port number of 80 and a destination: x.x.x.x and a port
                    number of P.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Applications & Application-layer Protocols</u>
                <p>Web - allows users to obtain documents from web server on demands.<br/>
                    Client and Server - A client sends a request and a server sends a response.<br/>
                    The server is a web server of an FTP server, etc. where it will provide
                    service(s) for others to use.<br/>The client is a web browser or FTP program
                    etc. that uses the services of the server.<br/>The server is always a host and
                    has a permanent IP address.<br/>The clients communicate with the server and may
                    be intermittently connected, they may also have dynamic IP addresses and don't
                    communicate with each other directly.<br/>An application needs no data loss in
                    apps and loss-tolerant apps.<br/>It also requires bandwidth at a certain
                    rate.<br/>It requires good timing, some applications require delays to be
                    effective.<br/>Applications also need security in the form of encryption and
                    data integrity etc.<br/>

                <br/>
                <u>Services</u>
                <p>TCP - Transmission Control Protocol, a connection-oriented service.<br/>UDP -
                    User Datagram Protocol, a connectionless service.<br/>TCP has reliable data
                    transfer, in the sense that it will have sensing protocols to see if the
                    transmission has been made and also protocols for retransmissions. In this
                    sense all the data will get to the client using TCP. TCP provides flow control
                    so that the sender can't overwhelm the receiver. TCP provides congestion
                    control so the sender will automatically buffer the sender so that the network
                    can recover from an overload.<br/>SMTP, HTTP, FTP and Telnet all use TCP.<br/>
                    There is also no guarantee that minimum transmission rate and delay can be
                    achieved.<br/>UDP has unreliable data transfer, meaning that there is no
                    guarantee that data will arrive and may arrive out of order. There is no flow
                    control or congestion control, in a sense it is a 'send and hope' method. It
                    tolerates some loss but does require a minimum rate so it is not completely
                    unreliable. It is used in Internet Telephony and Video Conferencing.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Pure Peer-to-peer Architecture</u>
                <p>Peers are intermittently connected and often change IP addresses dynamically,
                    the two end systems in a peer-to-peer network architecture can communicate
                    directly.<br/>It is highly scalable but difficult to manage.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Application Layer Protocol</u>
                <p>The protocol defines the types of messages being sent, so whether they are
                    request or response messages. They contain message syntax where it analyzes
                    the fields contained in a message and how fields are delineated. Message
                    semantics include the meaning of information in fields. Rules must also appear
                    for when and how processes send and respond to messages.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Web Terminology</u>
                <p>Web pages consist of objects.<br/>Objects can be HTML files, JPEG images or
                    plenty of other possibilities. If a page has text and three images for
                    example, it has four objects overall.<br/>In a URL (a uniform resource
                    locator), there are two segments after the definition of the network
                    application (http://), the host name and the path name. The host name will be
                    the actual server name of the website. It will also contain whether it's on
                    the WWW and what organization or country it belongs to. The path name is the
                    path in the directory of the servers to the web page the user requests.<br/>In
                    HTTP, the user will request a web page from a website, the browser will
                    request the objects from the page to the server. The server will receive the
                    request and responds with an HTTP response message that will contain the
                    objects.<br/>HTTP is stateless meaning the server maintains no information
                    about the past clients requests. If the object is asked again from the same
                    user, it will have to be resent.<br/>With non-persistent HTTP, one object at
                    most could be sent over a TCP connection. Persistent HTTP however can send
                    multiple objects over a single TCP connection between the client and
                    server.<br/>

                    There are status codes to HTTP responses such as the well-known 404, 505, 400,

                    status code where authorization would be required including a
                    WWW-Authentication header, the client will ask for the username and password

                    state storage on a client. The server will for example, send a set-cookie:
                    header instruction. This will be stored locally and when the page is requested
                    again the browser will append the cookie: header.<br/>A cookie has four
                    components; a cookie header line in the HTTP response message, a cookie header
                    in the HTTP request message, a cookie file kept on the user's end system and
                    managed by the user's browser and a back-end database at the web site.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Web Caches (Proxy Server)</u>
                <p>The goal in proxy servers is to satisfy the client request without involving
                    the origin server where the data is being sent from.<br/>The client will in
                    this case send a HTTP request to a proxy server, which then forwards the
                    request to the actual server, and then the data from the HTTP response is sent
                    to the proxy server which is then forwarded to the client.<br/>Caches act as
                    both a client and server where a client is just a client and a server is just
                    a server. The cache will send requests to the server and send the data to the
                    client, as the 'middleman'.<br/>Web caching improves performance to end users,
                    reduces the load on the servers, reduces bandwidth requirements, organizes web
                    request and data traffic and reduces cost.<br/>
                    Assume:<br/>
                    The delay from an institutional router to an origin server and back to the
                    router is 2 seconds.<br/>
                    The average request rate from an institution's browsers to origin servers is
                    15 per second.<br/>
                    The average object size is 100K bits.<br/>
                    The upgrade will be expensive but the cache is cheaper and faster than not
                    using one.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Electronic Mail</u>
                <p>Electronic mail has three main components: user agents, mail servers and simple
                    mail transfer protocol like SMTP or POP3.<br/>
                    A user agent or a mail reader composes, edits, reads, and mails messages, like
                    Outlook for example. The outgoing and incoming messages are stored on the
                    server.<br/>Mail servers have a mailbox that contains incoming messages for
                    the user, a message queue of outgoing messages to be sent and an SMTP protocol
                    between mail servers to send e-mail messages. The client in this case will
                    therefore be the sending mail server and the server is the receiving mail
                    server.<br/>TCP assigns port number 25 to SMTP. Direct transfer allows for no
                    multiple connections needed. There are three phases of transfer, handshaking,
                    transfer of the messages and closure. The command and response actions act as
                    ASCII text and status codes and phrases respectively. Messages are sent in
                    7-bit ASCII.<br/>Sending mail would go from Alice on a user agent, to a mail
                    server once the message has been sent. It is then sent from the mail server to
                    the destination mail server that serves the other user's ISP and then to the
                    user agent of the destination user.<br/>POP3 requires authorization in mail
                    for both sending and receiving ends and a download.<br/>IMAP is a more complex
                    transfer protocol that involves the manipulation of the stored messages on the
                    server.<br/>There are also web e-mail servers like Yahoo! Mail or Gmail,
                    etc.<br/>Folders are supported on a number if not all user agents. These help
                    organize messages. POP3 however does not provide means to create folders and
                    assign messages to folders.<br/>IMAP changes this by allowing the storage of
                    message folders on a server. Email is in folders from anywhere, however the
                    system can be slow and if the network disappears so does the e-mail.<br/>HTTP
                    web-based e-mail systems are better in the sense that users can access their
                    e-mail from multiple different platforms anywhere and simply through a web
                    browser. It is however, slower than user agents in separate applications with
                    limited display capabilities.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>DNS (Domain Name Service)</u>
                <p>Internet hosts and routers will have a hostname like www.facebook.com that is
                    human-readable and an IP address that is 32 bits long used for addressing
                    datagrams that are machine-readable.<br/>Name servers are one possible
                    solution to defining the names of machines. A single server on the Internet
                    that will do the translation autonomously. It will take requests, convert them
                    and then replies.<br/>There are however problems, there is a single point of
                    failure, too much traffic to handle all the queries, it will be a distant
                    centralized database which will result in a big delay and maintenance on name
                    servers is impossible.<br/>Distributed servers will reduce the load on a
                    single server and the system can still work if one system fails. These
                    distributed servers will also get to a larger span of clients.<br/>A
                    distributed database implemented in hierarchy of many name servers (DNS
                    servers).<br/>An application-layer protocol allows hosts to query the
                    distributed database and run between end systems using client-server paradigm,
                    it relies on underlying end-to-end transport protocol, it is not an
                    application with which a user directly interacts, its core function concerning
                    the Internet is to designate IP addresses. The complexity of a DNS is at the
                    network's edge as well.<br/>In this case, a user will send a HTTP request to
                    the web server. To do this though, the user will need to obtain the IP address
                    of the hostname. The browser will extract the hostname from the URL and then
                    send the hostname to the client-side DNS application. The DNS client-side
                    application will then send the IP address query to the DNS server. The DNS
                    server will return the requested IP address to the DNS client which will then
                    send the IP address to the browser which can then initiate the TCP connection,
                    assigning the request to a certain port number at that IP address.<br/>There
                    will be a root DNS server and then a series of com, org and edu, etc. DNS
                    servers that exist. These servers will each contain all of the hostnames
                    associated with that organization or country.<br/>All DNS servers must go
                    through the root.<br/>Top-level Domain Servers serve com, org, net, edu, gov,
                    etc. and all of the country top-level domains like uk, fr, ca, jp.<br/>
                    Authoritative DNS Servers serve IP mappings to organization's servers like web
                    or mail servers.<br/>A local name server does not strictly belong to the
                    hierarchy. Each ISP, company or university, etc. will have one.<br/>When a
                    host makes a DNS query, query is sent to its local DNS server.<br/>There can
                    be iterative queries to a local DNS server, where the client will request a
                    server and the DNS server will send that request to the RDNS server which will
                    respond back to the LDNS, this will be repeated with the other two required
                    servers in this situation.<br/>A recursive query is when the client requests a
                    server name and the LDNS server sends the request through all the servers to
                    the ADNS server and back all the way to the LDNS and back to the client.<br/>
                    Iterated queries by the root server are best to keep Internet performance
                    working.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>DNS Caching</u>
                <p>DNS caching involves all DNS servers being able to cache results which will in
                    turn improve the delay performance and reduce the number of DNS messages. TLD
                    servers are typically cached in local name servers.<br/>RR format for DNS
                    records is (name, value, type, ttl)<br/>
                    Type - A<br/>
                    Name is hostname<br/>
                    Value is IP address<br/>
                    Type - CNAME<br/>
                    Name is initial hostname<br/>
                    Value is the canonical name<br/>
                    Type - NS<br/>
                    Name is domain<br/>
                    Value is IP address of the authoritative name server for that domain<br/>
                    Type - MX<br/>
                    Value is the name of the mail server associated with the name.<br/>There is a
                    unique 16 bit identification number for a query that is also used in the
                    response. There are also flags: query or reply; recursion desired; recursion
                    available; reply is authoritative.<br/>DNS is carried over UDP, so small
                    messages or TCP for large messages and in both cases, it used port number
                    53.<br/>In a stack, the elements will act on the element above and use the
                    elements below.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Packets</u>
                <p>A packet is a block of bytes. The block has a header and a body. The Internet
                    is a packet-switched network.<br/>Each layer has a defined PDU and will add a
                    header to the PDU with its own information.<br/>
                    There are three layer functions:<br/>
                    Error control - will add reliability to the channel<br/>
                    Flow control - will avoid overwhelming slower end-station<br/>
                    Segmentation and Reassembly - will divide large message into smaller, easier
                    to handle chunks.<br/>
                    Multiplexing - will allow several high layer sessions to share a lower layer
                    session<br/>
                    Connection setup - will provide appropriate handshaking.<br/>
                    Advantages - Abstracts a complex system to a set of smaller systems and allows
                    for replacement of parts of the system.<br/>
                    Disadvantages - Often functionality is duplicated and a bad design will result
                    in information needing to be shared between layers.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Transport Services & Protocols</u>
                <p>Transport protocols provide logical communication between app process running
                    on different hosts.<br/>The transport protocol will send segments of the app
                    messages to the network layer which will then send the segments to the network
                    layer of the host on the receiving side, where the segments are reassembled
                    and the equivalent app messages are sent to the application layer.<br/>The
                    difference between the network layer and the transport layer is that the
                    network layer transmits data across the Internet to another host or server,
                    the transport layer will only transmit data between processes. They both work
                    together however.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Internet Transport-layer Protocols</u>
                <p>There are three possible settings for data transferral in the transport layer,
                    reliable, unreliable or services not available.<br/>TCP (reliable) will send
                    data in order and support congestion, flow control and connection setup. An
                    unreliable UDP will send data in any order and some is lost.<br/>Services not
                    available contains delay and bandwidth guarantees.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Multiplexing & Demultiplexing</u>
                <p>Multiplexing will involve the sender gathering data from multiple sockets and
                    enveloping the data with the header. The data will be sent and at the
                    receiving end, the delivered segments are made sure to go into the correct
                    socket.<br/>Demultiplexing works by the host receiving the IP datagrams. The
                    datagrams will each contain one segment. Each segment will contain both a
                    source and a destination port number. The host will use these numbers to know
                    which port to transmit the segment to.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>TCP Overview</u>
                <p>TCP is point-to-point meaning there is one receiver. It is reliable, meaning
                    data is transferred in order, it has send and receive buffers to allow for
                    multiple pieces of data to be sent without having to be completed. It has full
                    duplex data meaning bi-directional flow in the same connection. It is
                    connection-oriented meaning that handshaking is required to initiate the
                    sender and receiver's state before data exchange.<br/>The flow of data is also
                    controlled so the sender will not overwhelm the receiver.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>UDP - User Datagram Protocol</u>
                <p>UDP offers a 'best effort' service which means segments may be lost or
                    delivered out of order to the application. It is connectionless meaning that
                    no handshaking is required between a UDP sender and receiver. Each UDP segment
                    will be handled individually from others.<br/>UDP offers no delay to the
                    transmission of data, it is simple, with a small segment header and has no
                    congestion control meaning UDP can send its data as fast as possible.<br/>UDP
                    is loss tolerant and rate sensitive.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Network Layer</u>
                <p>The sending side takes the segments from the transport layer and encapsulates
                    each segment into a datagram. The datagram is then sent to the associated
                    router.<br/>The receiving side receives the datagram from the nearby router
                    and extracts the transport-layer segment, which it then transports to the
                    transport layer of the receiver host.<br/>The router will be forwarding
                    datagrams from input links and sending them through output links. It will also
                    examine the header fields in all IP datagrams passing through it.<br/>Packets
                    will be forwarded using a destination host address.<br/>The Internet network
                    layer provides a single service, the best effort service.<br/>The Internet is
                    a datagram network, providing a connectionless host-to-host service.<br/>There
                    are two main functions involved in the network layer, forwarding and
                    routing.<br/>Forwarding moves packets from the router's input to her
                    appropriate output.<br/>Routing determines the route taken by the packets from
                    the source to the destination.<br/>Routing contains a series of sequential
                    forwarding routines.<br/>In the router there is a forwarding table that maps
                    the destination address to the output link interface.<br/>An IP datagram has a
                    32 bit format containing a lot of data including the source IP, the
                    destination IP, the IP version, the length of the datagram in bytes, the upper
                    layer it is delivering the data to in the host, etc.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>IP Addressing</u>
                <p>An IP address has a 32 bit identifier, which is unique between hosts and
                    routers.<br/>The 32 bit number is split into 4, 8 bit segments that represent
                    the octets in an IP address.<br/>The dotted decimal notation is more simply
                    read by humans.<br/>10000000 10011100 00001110 00000111<br/>Is<br/>
                    128.156.14.7<br/>The network part of the IP address is the first three parts
                    of the IP address and the host part is the last segment of the IP
                    address.<br/>There are five classes of IP addresses. Class A is 0 followed by
                    the network part of 7 bits and the host part of 24 bits.<br/>1.0.0.0 to
                    127.255.255.255<br/>Class B is 10 followed by the network part of 14 bits and
                    the host part of 16 bits.<br/>128.0.0.0 to 191.255.255.255<br/>Class C is 110
                    followed by the network part of 21 bits and then the host part of 8 bits.<br/>
                    192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.255<br/>Class D is 1110 followed by a multicast
                    address.<br/>224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255<br/>Class E is 1111 followed by a
                    future use address.<br/>240.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255<br/>If the host is all
                    0's then it represents a network and if all the bits in the host part are 1's
                    then it is a broadcast.<br/>Class A also has a loopback address of
                    127.0.0.1.<br/>Class A has 8 bits per network part, class B has 16 bits per
                    network part, class C has 24 bits per network and class D has multicast.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Subnets</u>
                <p>A class A network will have millions of hosts, so to deal with high demand,
                    subnetting is used.<br/>The network portion of an IP address uniquely
                    identifies a physical network.<br/>The subnet number is created from the bits
                    in the host number part.<br/>The binary representation of the number will
                    equal the number of subnets on the network.<br/>Devices in a network are
                    divided up into subnets by dividing one IP address into a number of subnets,
                    so 223.1.1.4, 223.1.2.9 and 223.1.3.27 would all stem from one router.<br/>If
                    223.1.1.0/24 is the subnet IP address  then the 24 at the end represents the
                    left-most 24 bits of a 32 bit quantity IP address.</p>

                <p>The CIDR is the subnet portion of the address that is always a fixed, arbitrary

                <p>When there are a large amount of IP addresses to manage, subnet masking is used
                    to break the host ID portion of the address into a subnet ID and a host
                    ID.<br/>The subnet mask will show the number of bits that make up the network

                <u>Link Layer</u>
                <p>The link layer provides data transfer between neighbouring network elements
                    like PPP or the Ethernet.<br/>In link terminology, the hosts and routers will
                    be nodes. The channels connecting two nodes are called links, whether they be
                    wired, wireless or LANs. A link layer packer is called a frame which is an
                    encapsulated datagram.<br/>A transmitting node will encapsulate the datagram
                    into a link layer frame and transmit the frame into the link.<br/>A receiving
                    node receives the frame and extracts the datagram.<br/>Where the network
                    layer governs the overall path of data through the Internet, the link layer
                    provides transmission over a single link in the data's path.<br/>Each link
                    can and probably will differ in link protocol services, between PPP and
                    Ethernet.<br/>The frame will have a header just like a datagram but it will
                    use the source MAC address as source identification and NOT the IP
                    address.<br/>Other link layer services include flow control so that there is
                    pacing between adjacent sending and receiving nodes. Error detection provides
                    error-detection bits in the frame. Error correction will receive the frames
                    and correct any bit errors in frames with errors. Half-duplex functionality
                    provides that both ends of the link can transmit data, but not at the same
                    time.<br/>The link layer is implemented in the Network Interface Card. It
                    attaches into host's system buses.<br/>The adapter will receive a datagram
                    from an upper layer and encapsulate that datagram into a frame, as well as
                    adding other functionalities. The receiving side will receive the frame at
                    the adapter and extract the datagram, then pass to the receiving node and
                    then the upper layers at the receiving side.<br/>The adapter would've also
                    performed error-checking and correcting of packets.<br/>There are two types
                    of link layer channels: a broadcast channel and a point-to-point
                    communication link. The broadcast channel provides many hosts to the same
                    communication channel. This channel will coordinate transmission and avoid
                    collisions.<br/>A point-to-point communication link provides transmission
                    between two routers, normally exampled in a residential dial-up modem and an
                    ISP router. The data transfer will be reliable with flow control and error
                    detection.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Multiple Access Protocols</u>
                <p>These protocols are needed for a single shared broadcast channel or with two
                    or more simultaneous transmissions by nodes as without the protocol there
                    will be a collision.<br/>It will be a distributed algorithm to determine how
                    nodes share a channel, and when each node can transmit data.<br/>There are
                    three classes to Multiple Access Control Protocols.<br/>Channel partitioning
                    divides the channel into smaller pieces and will allocate a piece to a node
                    for exclusive use.<br/>Random access will not divide the channel and will
                    allow collisions but will simply recover from them when they happen.<br/>
                    Taking turns is simply where the nodes take turns but nodes with more to send
                    can have longer to send it.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Random Access Protocols</u>
                <p>Random access protocols transmit and hope that there won't be a collision. A
                    random access protocol will detect collisions and knows how to recover from
                    them.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>MAC Addresses</u>
                <p>MAC addresses are the link layer addresses of a node's adapter that are 48
                    bits long and do not change for an adapter.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)</u>
                <p>ARP resolves an IP address to a MAC address. It only resolves these addresses
                    for nodes on the same subnet as the host. DNS differs as it resolves an IP
                    address from a hostname and operates throughout the Internet.<br/>Ethernet
                    was the first wired LAN technology and was cheap for the 100Mb/s speed.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Contention-based Protocols</u>
                <p>If two workstations transmit data simultaneously, there can be a collision. To
                    prevent this from happening, when the two nodes hear the collision they will
                    stop transmitting data immediately.<br/>Ethernet uses CSMA/CD to prevent
                    collisions. First the adapter won't transmit if it senses another node's
                    transmission. A transmitting adapter will also stop immediately after it
                    senses an adapter transmitting. Before waiting to start up again, the adapter
                    will wait a random amount of time, (known as random access).<br/>10BaseT and
                    100BaseT are both types of Ethernet, the first running at 10Mbs and the
                    second running at 100Mbs.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Hubs</u>
                <p>Hubs are physical layer repeaters. Bits coming from one link go out all other
                    links at the same rate.<br/>There is no collision detection at the hub, the
                    NIC of the host detects any collisions.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Switch</u>
                <p>A switch is a link layer device that stores Ethernet frames. It will examine
                    the header and forward the frame based on that MAC address stored in the
                    header.<br/>Switches are transparent meaning that the hosts are unaware of
                    the presence of switches. They are also plug-and-play and self-learning,
                    meaning that they don't have to be configured and can simply learn.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Traffic Isolation</u>
                <p>A switch will break a subnet into LAN segments. It will then filter the
                    packets. These segments become individual collision domains and will not
                    normally forward frames to other LAN segments in the same LAN.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Dedicated Access</u>
                <p>Dedicated access gives hosts direct access to the switch, no hub will be
                    involved. This will prevent collisions and provide full duplex.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Switches vs. Routers</u>
                <p>Switches forward frames in LANs and routers forward datagrams over the
                    Internet as part of routing.<br/>Switches will also have switch tables, while
                    routers will have routing tables.<br/>
                    PDU Types for each layer:<br/>
                    Application - Messages<br/>
                    Transport - Segments<br/>
                    Network - Datagrams<br/>

                <br/>
                <u>Security</u>
                <p>We need network security for authentication, identification, and preventing
                    denial of service to authorized users.<br/>
                    Confidentiality - only the sender and the intended receiver will understand
                    the contents of the message.<br/>
                    Authentication - the sender and the receiver want to confirm the identity of
                    each other.<br/>
                    Message integrity and Non-repudiation - to analyze a message and tell whether
                    the message has been altered or not.<br/>
                    Access and Availability - services must be accessible and available to
                    users.<br/>
                    The three main network security issues are trust, snooping and spoofing.
                    Trust involves trusting all of the nodes on the routing path and that they
                    won't look at or even edit the data the user is sending. Snooping is the
                    situation where hubs have the ability to broadcast, in which case anyone
                    could see the packets. Switches could stop this problem but can't guarantee
                    it. Spoofing involves someone seeing someone else's packets and forging new
                    packets while discarding the originals.<br/>
                    Alice and Bob are the main two protagonists in network security with Trudy
                    being the malicious node. The people can represent end-users, servers, hubs
                    or switches, DNS servers or any other aspect to the Internet in data
                    transmission really.<br/>The malicious user can eavesdrop on virtual
                    conversations, insert messages into the connection channel, impersonate
                    other nodes or even take over an ongoing connection by removing the sender or
                    the receiver with him/herself. Malicious users can also prevent some services
                    from being used by others.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Encryption & Decryption</u>
                <p>Encryption will work by converting plain text into cipher text. This form of
                    data obfuscation often comes with a key that has the ability to lock the
                    message and after the message has been sent, the key will unlock the
                    messages.<br/>A symmetrical key is a key where both sender and receiver have
                    the same key.<br/>A public key is a key that will encrypt the message and
                    will require a private key to decrypt the message at the other end.<br/>If
                    only the cipher text is known, the only way to decrypt without the key is
                    statistical analysis. If some of the plain text is known, then it becomes a
                    little easier to decipher and if a particular area of text is deciphered, the
                    overall deciphering will become even more easier.<br/>Key distribution is
                    hard as a separate communication path will be needed to send the key data.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Data Encryption Standard</u>
                <p>The key would normally be 64 bits with an 8 bit odd parity.<br/>A triple data
                    encryption standard or advanced encryption standard would be to use three
                    keys to encrypt, decrypt and then encrypt again.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Public Key Cryptography</u>
                <p>The sender and the receiver will not share the private key. The public key is
                    known to everyone and the private key is only known by the receiver.<br/>
                    If only one key was obtained, the other key would still be very hard to
                    obtain computationally.<br/>While using A's public and private keys, it is
                    possible to decrypt a message using the private or the public key first.<br/>
                    In a real-life example, Alice would get Bob's public key when she wants to
                    send a message to him, Bob would have his own private key and the message
                    would be encrypted using the public key and decrypted using the private
                    key.<br/>When A is sending a message to B, A will encrypt with B's public key
                    and encrypt the result with A's private key. B will receive the message and
                    decrypts the result and the initial message using A's public key followed by
                    B's private key.<br/>
                    Secrecy - only the receiver can read the message<br/>
                    Authentication - the identity of the sender is assured<br/>
                    Non-repudiation - the identity of the sender cannot be denied<br/>
                    Integrity - the message has not been altered in transit</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Authentication Protocol</u>
                <p>Establish the identities of the parties to each other's satisfaction. Only
                    after they are both satisfied can the transmission begin.<br/>There are many
                    ways that malicious users can lead hosts astray on this topic. The best way
                    however to send a message for authentication is to send the message and have
                    a nonce reply returned where Alice would have to resend the nonce, encrypted
                    with a shared private key.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Digital Signatures</u>
                <p>In this case, the sender will provide a digital signature establishing that he
                    is the creator. If is verifiable and non-forgettable. Documents are digitally
                    signed by the sender putting their private key on the message.<br/>If the
                    receiver receives the message, they can know it was the sender if they use
                    the sender's public key and output the decrypted message. This will prove
                    that no one else could've wrote the message as only the sender will know
                    their private key. This will provide non-repudiation as a form of
                    security.<br/>Long messages are too computationally hard to encrypt using a
                    public key system. Instead the message must be simplified down to its hash
                    form where the message is a fixed size. A digital signature will simply be a
                    signed message digest with the sender's private key. The encrypted message
                    digest and large message are then sent and both picked up by the receiver.
                    The encrypted message digest has to be decrypted with B's public key and the
                    large message has to be hashed. If H(m)=H(m) then it is verified that Bob did
                    send and sign that message.<br/>The signature will be produced from the
                    hashed message that has been created being put at the bottom of the
                    message.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Key Problems</u>
                <p>The symmetric key problem, where it is unknown on how the sender and receiver
                    will both have the same private key over a network. The solution would be to
                    use KDC (key distribution centre) that acts as an intermediary.<br/>The
                    public key problem is to know that the sender actually sent the message and
                    not any malicious user. The solution is to use the CA or certification
                    authority.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Firewalls</u>
                <p>Firewalls isolate an organization's internal net from the larger Internet,
                    allowing some packets to pass and preventing the others.<br/>The decision by
                    a router firewall to either forward a packet or drop it is based on the
                    addresses associated with the packet, the port numbers associated and other
                    bits.<br/>Some applications will have gateways that filter packets.
                    Authorized users of, say a Telnet system will be able to set up a connection
                    with another host. The router filter will block all Telnet connection not
                    originating from the gateway.<br/>The router filter will make sure that all
                    Telnet connections originate from the gateway.</p>
