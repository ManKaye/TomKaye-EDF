                <u>Privacy & Network Technologies</u>
                <p>Privacy - the ability of an individual or group to seclude/isolate themselves or
                    information about themselves and thereby reveal themselves selectively.<br/>
                    Privacy (2) - The right to be left alone.<br/>Physical Privacy - the prevention
                    from intrusions into one's physical space or solitude.<br/>Levels of privacy
                    change between location and time period with relation to privacy law changes,
                    etc.<br/>In terms of computer science, freedom from surveillance is part of
                    privacy. Individuals have an ability to keep electronic communications and
                    personal information confidential.<br/>Individuals have different attitudes
                    towards privacy. These differences can be seen throughout culture and these
                    different attitudes influence individual's behaviour on other people and their
                    privacy.<br/>There are three main types of privacy attitudes:<br/>
                    - Privacy Fundamentalists who place high value on privacy.<br/>
                    - Privacy Pragmatists have strong feelings on privacy just like the
                    fundamentalists, however they can be willing to surrender privacy in certain
                    conditions where care is used.<br/>
                    - Privacy Unconcerned have no real concerns about privacy or how their personal
                    information may be used.<br/>
                    These attitudes can change over time for each individual.<br/>Privacy rights
                    are often expressed in legislation as security like in the Human Rights Act,
                    1998 and the 4th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.<br/>Human Rights Article
                    8 - Right to Respect for Private and Family Life<br/>
                    - Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home
                    and his correspondence.<br/>
                    - There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of
                    this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a
                    democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the
                    economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime,
                    for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and
                    freedom of others.<br/>
                    Exemptions to Article 8 include:<br/>
                    - National Security<br/>
                    - Public Safety<br/>
                    - Economic well-being of the country<br/>
                    - Prevention of disorder or crime<br/>
                    - Protection of health or morals<br/>
                    - For the protection of the rights and freedom of others<br/>
                    The 4th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, 1791<br/>
                    "Their right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and
                    effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and
                    no warrants shall ensure, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or
                    affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the
                    persons or things to be seized."<br/>The action of CCTV surveillance on
                    innocent people could be seen as an invasion of privacy.<br/>Calling a taxi and
                    giving out all the necessary information and the taxi driver misses a call, the
                    information has gone out and the person has not got the taxi.<br/>Privacy in a
                    network context is unclear as the boundaries between public and private space
                    are not clear. This makes the digital, network and Internet footprints that are
                    collected and exchanged on an unprecedented scale, there are secondary uses of
                    the data and also data matching.<br/>Internet footprints include logins with
                    username and password and HTTP requests, they also log the conversion of the
                    domain name to the IP address and the conversion of the IP address to the MAC
                    address as well as server requests and HTTP responses.<br/>Therefore people can
                    be identified from a login name, a MAC address, an IP address, a URL address or
                    cookies.<br/>In Google's search history, a person's intentions can be found in
                    the URL address under the search string part of the address.<br/>In a network
                    context, E-commerce compiles millions of pieces of information for each
                    customer and use purchase analysis to develop advertising.<br/>Google ads cater
                    the advertisements to your search history with them.<br/>Spam E-mails send vast
                    amounts of messages to victims without their permission.<br/>Data can sometimes
                    be redistributed to third party companies or bodies. This can make it difficult
                    for the customer to remain in control of the privacy of their data.<br/>Data
                    matching is the combining and comparing of personal information from different
                    databases. It enables parties to gain an fairly detailed picture of that person
                    and has a potential for misuse of information.<br/>The cloud, your personal
                    computer, your local network and the data held in your company or any other
                    organization you're a part of all have your personal information nine times out
                    of ten and the privacy levels of this personal information varies between each
                    medium.<br/></p>
                <br/>
                <u>Informed Consent</u>
                <p>When an individual agrees to something, they should be informed. An informed
                    consent can be said to have been given upon a clear appreciation and
                    understanding of the facts, implications, and future consequences of an action.
                    It is the key to the UK Data Protection Act of 1998.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Opt-out vs. Opt-in</u>
                <p>Opting-out is where a user explicitly forbids an organization from sharing
                    information with other organizations. In an opting out environment, both
                    parties involved will mostly keep each other on one another's mailing lists.<br/>
                    Opting-in is where a user explicitly gives permission to the organization that
                    they can distribute the information with the selected organization. This act
                    takes information as a commodity away from companies.<br/>Companies and
                    organizations prefer opting out and opting in is preferred by privacy
                    advocates.<br/>The Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations,
                    2003<br/>The UK follows the opt-in scheme under its provisions. In essence, it
                    states that senders cannot send marketing messages unless they have the
                    recipient's prior consent or unless the recipient's email address was
                    collected in the course of a sale. The sender sends only mail related to
                    similar services or products and when the address was collected, the recipient
                    was given the opportunity to opt-out, which they did not take.<br/>Two new
                    rules for e-mail marketing arose from this, the sender must not conceal their
                    identity and the sender must provide a valid address for opt-out requests.</p>

                <u>Office of the Information Commissioner</u>
                <p>This office upholds information rights in the public interest, promoting
                    openness by public bodies and data privacy for individuals.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>CAN SPAM Act of 2003 (US)</u>
                <p>This act allowed for spam e-mail to be sent with the requirement that it must
                    state clearly that it is an advertisement and not an important e-mail. Users
                    can also be given the ability to opt-out from future mailings.<br/>

                    information.<br/>Google, Yahoo and Microsoft all anonymize their links between
                    search terms and IP addresses after a certain, varied amount of time.<br/>

                <u>Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (RIPA), 2000</u>
                <p>The home secretary can order that the external communications of a
                    telecommunications service be intercepted. When an ISP is hit with an
                    interception warrant, it has to comply and it may not reveal that the warrant
                    has been put through at all.<br/>The criticisms of RIPA include the
                    unrestricted access to electronic communications, the infringement of privacy
                    of correspondence, ISPs have to install back doors into their systems that
                    these surveillance organizations can use.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Why Is Information Shared?</u>
                <p>Information is shared for many reasons including health with regards to
                    hospitals, the law with regards to courts and police stations, education with
                    regards to schools and universities, etc.<br/>Examples of improvements made
                    individually could be hospitals as an example. Hospitals could anonymize the
                    results for predictive tests while keeping diagnostic test results public.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Ethics & Information</u><br/>
                <u>Ethical Dilemmas</u>
                <p>Ethical dilemmas can occur every day and can be good or bad. For example,
                    illegal activity is a negative ethical dilemma and helping an elderly person
                    cross the road is a positive dilemma.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Information in Modern Society</u>
                <p>Workplace pressures regarding information in modern society include the
                    authentication of credentials and the monitoring of employees. Social
                    pressures include CCTV, interception of communications and the need for
                    financial transparency.<br/>When working with this information, it is
                    necessary to have a firm understanding on ethical values and the law, and then
                    to recognize the difference between the two conceptual entities. It is also
                    wise to know that laws are easier to define than ethics.<br/>
                    Ethics - the science of duty, or the branch of knowledge that deals with moral
                    obligations in a society.<br/>Ethics is, in a sense, the even distribution of
                    all individuals' morals in a society to form a median moral, taking into
                    account, all the different cultures and political or religious viewpoints of
                    that society.<br/>There are two main approaches to decoding ethics. One is the
                    utilitarian view and one is the deontological view. The utilitarian view
                    handicaps the party that will have less impact on society. If a man has to
                    save either a baby, or a scientist with the cure for cancer, a utilitarian
                    view would govern that the scientist be saved.<br/>A deontological view will
                    govern that the protocol of society determine the outcome of the ethical
                    dilemma in our current society.<br/>In Layman's terms, utilitarianism governs
                    the morality of an action based on the outcome and deontologism governs the
                    morality of an action based on the duties of the individual.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Ethical Decision-making</u>
                <p>In practice we might consider any of the following in making an ethical
                    decision: the best consequences, the moral rights, fairness, the common good
                    and setting an example.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Torts</u>
                <p>Tort law deals with our obligation to other member's of society and our
                    liability for our actions.<br/>Every person within society has an obligation
                    not to harm other member's of society. The torts involved with this obligation
                    include: negligence, defamation, breach of confidence and trespassing.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Negligence</u>
                <p>Negligence is the situation where an individual performs an action
                    unsatisfactorily and then does not provide communication to any other member
                    of society detailing that the action has been performed unsatisfactorily.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Defamation</u>
                <p>Defamation includes statements that harm someone else or their business interests.
                    Slander and libel are the two forms of defamation. Slander is spoken defamation.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Breach of Confidence</u>
                <p>A breach of confidence is an instance where personal, private or even
                    Government-classified information is given out to the public through some
                    means.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Trespass</u>
                <p>Trespassing is a simple tort, preventing an individual from non-consensually
                    entering another individual's or party's owned land or premises.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Managing Workplace Ethics</u>
                <p>A manager of a company can intervene with ethical dilemmas on multiple
                    different levels, depending on the severity of the ethical dilemma. A small
                    and insignificant ethical dilemma may demand an informal discussion
                    accompanied with warnings to the culprits. A slightly more critical ethical
                    dilemma may entail formal discussions and disciplinary procedures. Moving on
                    to even more endangering ethical dilemmas, some of the worst scenarios demand
                    legal or other advice along with mediation and in the worst cases, alerting of
                    the police or security services.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Freedom of Expression</u>
                <p>Freedom of expression is the right to express one's ideas or opinions freely
                    through speech, writing or any other form of communication. Freedom of the
                    press is part of freedom of expression as well.<br/>Currently, censorship
                    plays a large part in the controversy of freedom of expression.<br/>Censorship
                    is the suppression and regulation of communication, visually or sonically
                    because the material in question is considered immoral, libelous, damaging to
                    state security or otherwise offensive. Censorship can be pre or
                    post-publication of material and can vary on levels of intensity in a country
                    depending on that country's situation in terms of leadership or whether they
                    are in a state of war.</p>

                    exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and
                    responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions
                    or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic

                <p>Defamation is the publication of a statement which reflects on a person's
                    reputation and tends to lower him in the estimation of right-thinking members
                    of society generally or tends to make them shun or avoid him.<br/>Libel is the
                    'textual' form of defamation and slander is the spoken form of defamation.<br/>
                    The defamation act of 2013 was made to balance the legal power between freedom
                    of expression and the right to defend one's reputation. Serious harm must be
                    shown, however to be able to sue for defamation.</p>

                <u>Data Protection</u>
                <p>Informational privacy is the ability for individuals to exert control over
                    their personal information versus the need of authorities and organizations to
                    process personal information to meet their goals and/or provide products and
                    services.<br/>Data protection is relevant as it is meant to help protect your
                    interests as a private citizen.<br/>Data protection laws are governed by the
                    content of personal data, data subjects, controllers and processors, data
                    protection principles, data subject rights and the independent regulator.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Data Protection Principles</u>
                <p>- Data is processed fairly and lawfully<br/>
                    - It is obtained for one or more specified and lawful purposes<br/>
                    - Data is processed for adequate, relevant and not excessive reasons<br/>
                    - The data is accurate and up-to-date<br/>
                    - The data is not to be kept longer than is necessary<br/>
                    - The data is processed in accordance with the rights of the data subjects<br/>
                    - Appropriate measures are taking to remedy any unlawful reasons for acquiring
                    data<br/>
                    - Personal data shall not be transferred to another country unless that
                    country has an adequate level of protection for said data</p>
                <br/>
                <u>The Rights of Data Subjects</u>
                <p>The subjects must be told that their data is being acquired, they must inspect
                    the data themselves, prevent the deletion, amendation and processing of the
                    data that needs to be acquired and can sue for any damages caused to that
                    data.<br/>Unlawful acquirement of data can only override hacking laws if the
                    acquirement of the data is in the best interests of the public as a measure of
                    national security.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>The Role of Privacy Policies</u>
                <p>Privacy policies inform the public on what data is being collected and for what
                    purpose, etc.<br/>They also are there to provide information on how the
                    publics' information can be protected.<br/>It informs the public on how to
                    contact the data controller.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Improving Privacy Policies</u>
                <p>Privacy policies can also be improved in multiple different ways. The English
                    of the laws and policies could be altered, shortened but with access to the
                    more detailed versions and with icons that visually describe each policy of
                    the law.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Cookies</u>
                <p>Cookies are the metadata information of website activity by a user. Under the
                    Cookie Law, explicit consent is required before setting cookies. Under a take
                    it or leave it approach, if a user refuses to accept cookies, then they can be
                    refused access to the website.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Benefits</u>
                <p>Potential problems regarding data are identified at an early stage, when
                    addressing them will often be simpler and less costly. Information and
                    knowledge across organizations are improved and as such, so are their legal
                    obligations to follow these privacy policies.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>The Right to Be Forgotten</u>
                <p>The right to be forgotten is an aspect of privacy policies, where an
                    individual, in certain circumstances can make information about them can be
                    made inaccessible.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Forensics</u>
                <p>Forensics is the capture, interrogation and investigation of digital devices.
                    The aim is to intelligently identify intelligence and evidence in a legally
                    defensible manner to support client requirements.<br/>A hard disk contains an
                    index and a data area. Index numbers will have pathways to certain pieces of
                    data. Upon formatting, these pathways are scrapped and the data in the data
                    area is made a soft copy, so the data can be overwritten.<br/>Vulnerable data
                    and files can be found in mapped drives, USB drives, user credentials and
                    system information.<br/>In terms of computers, the device itself, any SIM
                    cards associated with the phone and additional memory cards.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Disclosure</u>
                <p>Disclosure is a legal process whereby each party is required to disclose the
                    documents that are relevant to the issues in dispute to the other party.</p>
                <br/>

                    Concepts and Clustering<br/>
                    Forensics is quite a circular process where repetitions are needed to get a
                    positive outcome.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Security</u>
                <p>Security is the degree of protection against a danger or threat. It is needed
                    to protect valuable assets of some sort.<br/>There are three aspects to a
                    hazard where security would need to be involved: a threat, a vulnerability and
                    a control.<br/>There are four types of threats to information security, these
                    are interception, interruption, modification and fabrication.<br/>Interception
                    is where an unauthorized party has gained access to a private asset.<br/>
                    Interruption is where the private asset belonging to a system is lost,
                    unavailable or unusable.<br/>Modification is where an unauthorized party has
                    tampered with a private asset.<br/>Fabrication is where an unauthorized party
                    has created a fabrication of a private asset which replaces said asset.<br/>
                    The goals of security include three main points.<br/>Confidentiality ensures
                    that only authorized parties are allowed access to the private assets.<br/>
                    Integrity ensures that only authorized parties are allowed to modify data.<br/>
                    Availability ensures that all the authorized parties are allowed access to the
                    private assets at all of the appropriate times.<br/>Building a secure system
                    is finding the right balance between these three goals.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Hackers</u>
                <p>Hackers are people who seek to exploit vulnerabilities in a computer system or
                    computer network to obtain illegal access to them.<br/>There are two types of
                    hackers, malicious hackers who can use quick-and-dirty hacking tactics or neat
                    and robust, undetected attacks. There are also ethical hackers who provide
                    penetration tests and vulnerability assessments within a contractual agreement
                    or unpaid security consultants. In other words they hack for the public
                    interest, basically hacking to prevent methods that malicious hackers could
                    find and use to abuse a computer system.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Methods of Defense</u>
                <p>There are five methods of defense when it comes to security.<br/>
                    Prevention is blocking the attack.<br/>
                    Deterration is making any attack much harder to succeed.<br/>
                    Deflection is making a dummy target a more attractive victim.<br/>
                    Detection is making it aware that someone is actively trying to hack a
                    computer system.<br/>
                    Recovery is recovering from any attacks to a computer system that do
                    succeed.<br/>
                    These methods can be further split up to preemption, where the hacker is
                    simply prevented from attacking. Another is external prevention where the
                    hackers are prevented from attacking before reaching the system. An external
                    deterrence is where an attacker is deterred while trying to enter the system.
                    An internal prevention will prevent attackers after they have gained illegal
                    access to the computer system. Internal deterrence will deter an attacker
                    after they have gained access to a computer system. Faux environments can be
                    used to lead off detected attackers through deflection. Detection is used to
                    detect the intruders after they are in the system. A response will then be
                    issued to deal with the detected attackers.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Encryption</u>
                <p>Encryption is the process of transforming information using an algorithm to
                    make it unreadable to anyone except those possessing special knowledge,
                    usually referred to as a key.<br/>There are two main forms of encryption,
                    asymmetric encryption and symmetrical encryption. Asymmetric encryption is a
                    more complex form of encryption that uses two keys; one for encryption and one
                    for decryption. They are called asymmetric keys. Symmetrical encryption is a
                    form of encryption that uses the same cryptographic keys for both decryption
                    and encryption. These keys are called symmetrical keys.<br/>Encryption
                    addresses confidentiality as it ensures that only authorized parties can gain
                    access to private data. It also addresses integrity in the sense that the data
                    cannot be changed by unauthorized parties.<br/>Weak encryption can be worse
                    than no encryption at all in the sense that it gives users an unwarranted
                    sense of protection.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Cryptography's Network Applications</u>
                <p>Authentication is the process of proving one's identity to someone else. In the
                    case of information technology, a digital signature is used to confirm to the
                    receiver that the message received was indeed from the right sender.<br/>

                <u>Trusted Certification Authority (CA)</u>
                <p>A CA issues a digital certificate to a receiver that contains a public key and
                    the identity of the owner.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Transport Layer Security (TLS)</u>
                <p>TLS is the general-purpose protocol used for sending encrypted information over
                    the Internet, through HTTP, FTP, etc. It falls between the transport and
                    application layers.<br/>TLS negotiates a stateful connection between client
                    and server where they establish a connection's security before beginning
                    communication.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>TCP/IP Vulnerabilities</u>
                <p>Snooping is one vulnerability for the model where potential hackers can gain
                    access to your travelling packets.<br/>Spoofing is where one of the packets
                    that a user has sent is intercepted by a hacker and replaced with a forged
                    packet.</p>
                <br/>
                <u>Computer Crime vs. Cybercrime</u>
                <p>Computer crime is an offense committed through the use of a computer, so some
                    form of sexual offense or embezzlement offense for example.<br/>A cyber crime
                    refers to offenses against a computer or similar device, so hacking and denial
                    of services, etc.</p>

                <u>The Computer Misuse Act</u>
                <p>Unauthorized access to computer material is not allowed.<br/>Unauthorized
                    access to computer material with the intent to commit or facilitate further
                    offenses.<br/>Unauthorized acts with intent to impair, or with recklessness as
