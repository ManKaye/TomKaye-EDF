                <h2><u>The Unexpected Hanging Paradox</u></h2>
                <p>A judge tells a condemned prisoner that he will be hanged at noon on one 
                    weekday in the following week but that the execution will be a surprise to 
                    the prisoner. He will not know the day of the hanging until the executioner 
                    knocks on his cell door at noon that day.<br/>
                    Having reflected on his sentence, the prisoner draws the conclusion that he 
                    will escape from the hanging. His reasoning is in several parts. He begins 
                    by concluding that the "surprise hanging" can't be on Friday, as if he 
                    hasn't been hanged by Thursday, there is only one day left - and so it won't 
                    be a surprise if he's hanged on Friday. Since the judge's sentence stipulated 
                    that the hanging would be a surprise to him, he concludes it cannot occur on 
                    Friday.<br/>
                    He then reasons that the surprise hanging cannot be on Thursday either, 
                    because Friday has already been eliminated and if he hasn't been hanged by 
                    Wednesday night, the hanging must occur on Thursday, making a Thursday 
                    hanging not a surprise either. By similar reasoning he concludes that the 
                    hanging can also not occur on Wednesday, Tuesday or Monday. Joyfully he 
                    retires to his cell confident that the hanging will not occur at all.<br/>
                    The next week, the executioner knocks on the prisoner's door at noon on 
                    Wednesday - which, despite all the above, was an utter surprise to him. 
                    Everything the judge said came true.

                <h2><u>Quantum Suicide & Immortality</u></h2>
                <p>In quantum mechanics, quantum suicide is a thought experiment, originally 
                    published independently by Hans Moravec in 1987 and Bruno Marchal in 
                    1988, and independently developed further by Max Tegmark in 1998. It 
                    attempts to distinguish between the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum 
                    mechanics and the Everett many-worlds interpretation by means of a variation 
                    of the Schr√∂dinger's cat thought experiment, from the cat's point of view. 
                    Quantum immortality refers to the subjective experience of surviving quantum 
                    suicide regardless of the odds.<br/>
                    Keith Lynch recalls that Hugh Everett took great delight in paradoxes such 
                    as the unexpected hanging. Everett did not mention quantum suicide or 
                    quantum immortality in writing, but his work was intended as a solution to 
                    the paradoxes of quantum mechanics. Lynch said "Everett firmly believed that 
                    his many-worlds theory guaranteed him immortality: his consciousness, he 
                    argued, is bound at each branching to follow whatever path does not lead to 
                    death"; Tegmark explains, however, that life and death situations do not 
                    normally hinge upon a sequence of binary quantum events like those in the 
                    thought experiment.
