                <h2><u>The Unexpected Hanging Paradox</u></h2>
                <p>A judge tells a condemned prisoner that he will be hanged at noon on one 
                    weekday in the following week but that the execution will be a surprise to 
                    the prisoner. He will not know the day of the hanging until the executioner 
                    knocks on his cell door at noon that day.<br/>
                    Having reflected on his sentence, the prisoner draws the conclusion that he 
                    will escape from the hanging. His reasoning is in several parts. He begins 
                    by concluding that the "surprise hanging" can't be on Friday, as if he 
                    hasn't been hanged by Thursday, there is only one day left - and so it won't 
                    be a surprise if he's hanged on Friday. Since the judge's sentence stipulated 
                    that the hanging would be a surprise to him, he concludes it cannot occur on 
                    Friday.<br/>
                    He then reasons that the surprise hanging cannot be on Thursday either, 
                    because Friday has already been eliminated and if he hasn't been hanged by 
                    Wednesday night, the hanging must occur on Thursday, making a Thursday 
                    hanging not a surprise either. By similar reasoning he concludes that the 
                    hanging can also not occur on Wednesday, Tuesday or Monday. Joyfully he 
                    retires to his cell confident that the hanging will not occur at all.<br/>
                    The next week, the executioner knocks on the prisoner's door at noon on 
                    Wednesday - which, despite all the above, was an utter surprise to him. 
                    Everything the judge said came true.

                <h2><u>Quantum Suicide & Immortality</u></h2>
                <p>In quantum mechanics, quantum suicide is a thought experiment, originally 
                    published independently by Hans Moravec in 1987 and Bruno Marchal in 
                    1988, and independently developed further by Max Tegmark in 1998. It 
                    attempts to distinguish between the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum 
                    mechanics and the Everett many-worlds interpretation by means of a variation 
                    of the Schr&ouml;dinger's cat thought experiment, from the cat's point of view. 
                    Quantum immortality refers to the subjective experience of surviving quantum 
                    suicide regardless of the odds.<br/>
                    Keith Lynch recalls that Hugh Everett took great delight in paradoxes such 
                    as the unexpected hanging. Everett did not mention quantum suicide or 
                    quantum immortality in writing, but his work was intended as a solution to 
                    the paradoxes of quantum mechanics. Lynch said "Everett firmly believed that 
                    his many-worlds theory guaranteed him immortality: his consciousness, he 
                    argued, is bound at each branching to follow whatever path does not lead to 
                    death"; Tegmark explains, however, that life and death situations do not 
                    normally hinge upon a sequence of binary quantum events like those in the 
                    thought experiment.

                <h2><u>P vs. NP Problem</u></h2>
                <p>The P versus NP problem is a major unsolved problem in computer science. 
                    Informally speaking, it asks whether every problem whose solution can be 
                    quickly verified by a computer can also be quickly solved by a computer.<br/>
                    It was essentially first mentioned in a 1956 letter written by Kurt G&ouml;del to 
                    John von Neumann. G&ouml;del asked whether a certain NP-complete problem could be 
                    solved in quadratic or linear time. The precise statement of the P versus NP 
                    problem was introduced in 1971 by Stephen Cook in his seminal paper "The 
                    complexity of theorem proving procedures" and is considered by many to be 
                    the most important open problem in the field. It is one of the seven 
                    Millennium Prize Problems selected by the Clay Mathematics Institute to 
                    carry a US\$1,000,000 prize for the first correct solution.<br/>
                    The informal term quickly, used above, means the existence of an algorithm 
                    for the task that runs in polynomial time, i.e., that the time to complete 
                    the task varies as a polynomial function on the size of the input to the 
                    algorithm (as opposed to, say exponential time). The general class of 
                    questions for which some algorithm can provide an answer in polynomial time 
                    is called "class P" or just "P". For some questions, there is no known way 
                    to find an answer quickly, but if one is provided with information showing 
                    what the answer is, it is possible to verify the answer quickly. The class 
                    of questions for which an answer can be verified in polynomial time is 
                    called NP, which stands for "nondeterministic polynomial time."<br/>
                    Consider the subset sum problem, an example of a problem that is easy to 
                    verify, but whose answer may be difficult to compute. Given a set of 
                    integers, does some nonempty subset of them sum to 0? For instance, does a 
                    subset of the set {-2, -3, 15, 14, 7, -10} add up to 0? The answer "yes, 
                    because the subset {-2, -3, -10, 15} adds up to zero" can be quickly 
                    verified with three additions. There is no known algorithm to find such a 
                    subset in polynomial time (there is one, however, in exponential time, 
                    which consists of 2n-n-1 tries), but such an algorithm exists if P = NP; 
                    hence this problem is in NP (quickly checkable) but not necessarily in P 
                    (quickly solvable).<br/>
                    An answer to the P = NP question would determine whether problems that can 
                    be verified in polynomial time, like the subset-sum problem, can also be 
                    solved in polynomial time. If it turned out that $P \ne NP$, it would mean that 
                    there are problems in NP (such as NP-complete problems) that are harder to 
                    compute than to verify: they could not be solved in polynomial time, but 
                    the answer could be verified in polynomial time.<br/>
                    Aside from being an important problem in computational theory, a proof 
                    either way would have profound implications for mathematics, cryptography, 
                    algorithm research, artificial intelligence, game theory, multimedia 
                    processing, philosophy, economics and many other fields.

                <h2><u>The Dining Philosophers Problem</u></h2>
                <p><img src="Info Bucket/Image1.jpg" alt="First Image"  style="width: 50%;"><br/>
                    Five silent philosophers sit at a round table with bowls of spaghetti. Forks 
                    are placed between each pair of adjacent philosophers.<br/>
                    Each philosopher must alternately think and eat. However, a philosopher can 
                    only eat spaghetti when he has both left and right forks. Each fork can be 
                    held by only one philosopher and so a philosopher can use the fork only if 
                    it is not being used by another philosopher. After he finishes eating, he 
                    needs to put down both forks so they become available to others. A 
                    philosopher can take the fork on his right or the one on his left as they 
                    become available, but cannot start eating before getting both of them.<br/>
                    Eating is not limited by the remaining amounts of spaghetti or stomach 
                    space; an infinite supply and an infinite demand are assumed.<br/>
                    The problem is how to design a discipline of behavior (a concurrent 
                    algorithm) such that no philosopher will starve; i.e., each can forever 
                    continue to alternate between eating and thinking, assuming that no 
                    philosopher can know when others may want to eat or think.<br/>
                    <b>Problems</b><br/>
                    The problem was designed to illustrate the challenges of avoiding deadlock, 
                    a system state in which no progress is possible. To see that a proper 
                    solution to this problem is not obvious, consider a proposal in which each 
                    philosopher is instructed to behave as follows:<br/>
                    <span class="Box-Span">think until the left fork is available; when it is, pick it up;<br/>
                    think until the right fork is available; when it is, pick it up;<br/>
                    when both forks are held, eat for a fixed amount of time;<br/>
                    then, put the right fork down;<br/>
                    then, put the left fork down;<br/>
                    repeat from the beginning.<br/></span>
                    This attempted solution fails because it allows the system to reach a 
                    deadlock state, in which no progress is possible. This is a state in which 
                    each philosopher has picked up the fork to the left, and is waiting for the 
                    fork to the right to become available. With the given instructions, this 
                    state can be reached, and when it is reached, the philosophers will 
                    eternally wait for each other to release a fork.<br/>
                    Resource starvation might also occur independently of deadlock if a 
                    particular philosopher is unable to acquire both forks because of a timing 
                    problem. For example, there might be a rule that the philosophers put down 
                    a fork after waiting ten minutes for the other fork to become available and 
                    wait a further ten minutes before making their next attempt. This scheme 
                    eliminates the possibility of deadlock (the system can always advance to a 
                    different state) but still suffers from the problem of livelock. If all 
                    five philosophers appear in the dining room at exactly the same time and 
                    each picks up the left fork at the same time the philosophers will wait ten 
                    minutes until they all put their forks down and then wait a further ten 
                    minutes before they all pick them up again.<br/>
                    Mutual exclusion is the basic idea of the problem; the dining philosophers 
                    create a generic and abstract scenario useful for explaining issues of this 
                    type. The failures these philosophers may experience are analogous to the 
                    difficulties that arise in real computer programming when multiple programs 
                    need exclusive access to shared resources. These issues are studied in the 
                    branch of concurrent programming. The original problems of Dijkstra were 
                    related to external devices like tape drives. However, the difficulties 
                    exemplified by the dining philosophers problem arise far more often when 
                    multiple processes access sets of data that are being updated. Systems such 
                    as operating system kernels use thousands of locks and synchronizations 
                    that require strict adherence to methods and protocols if such problems as 
                    deadlock, starvation, or data corruption are to be avoided.
